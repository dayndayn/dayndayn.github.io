  <p>Honky Tonk Boys was/is a side project influenced by <br>
    blues, country and early rock&#146;n&#146;roll. Band members are <br>
    Lars P, David L and Bj&ouml;rn Radon. A 16 track cd was <br>
    released in may 2001, featuring &#148;Honky Tonk Love&#148;, <br>
    &#148;Honky Tonk Monkey&#148;, &#148;Honky Tonk Tattoo&#148;, &#148;Honky 
    Tonk <br>

    Blues&#148;, &#148;Honky Tonk Hit #305&#148; and lots more. There are<br>
    also rumours about a whole bunch of 12-bar blues <br>
    recordings sung in swedish that are still awaiting <br>
    release. <br>

    Smile</a> is a must if you&#146;re into beautiful ambient noise <br>
    that&#146;s unlike everything else. Mattias Ullman is the <br>
    genius behind this band, often featuring David on sax <br>
    or other stuff. ES released their first two cds in <br>
    1996 and 1998 on the legendary Releasing Eskimo label, <br>
    and has since released a couple of more albums which <br>
    you also should get. DL is particularly fond of the <br>

  <p>In 2001, David made a number of comic strips about <br>
    The Soundtrack Of Our Lives, collected in a booklet called <br>
    &quot;Cartoon Animals&quot; (yes, referring to the old Union Carbide classic) 
    <br>
    which was sold on TSOOL's tours and was to be included <br>
    in the 2-LP vinyl edition of their album &quot;Behind The Music&quot;. <br>

    In feb 2005, David released a &#8221;solo&#8221; 2-cd which is an utterly 
    weird <br>
    mish-mash of the rare, obscure and sometimes ridiculous: early <br>
    interviews &amp; radio snippets, &#8220;spoken word&#8221; home recordings 
    &amp; <br>
    &#8220;idea tapes&#8221; excerpts, experimental music tracks, unused <br>
    commissioned work for swedish tv, an answering machine hate <br>
    message, a Las Palmas cover, some Sugar Daddy noise jazz, and <br>
    more. Note: it&#8217;s definitely more fun if you know the swedish language, 
    <br>
    but even if not, there&#8217;s still enough music to satisfy the die-hard 
    fan. <br>
    Consider this a &#8220;fan club release&#8221; or official bootleg for &#8221;The 
    Dayw <br>
