    On March 3, 2005, it was time to try a new version of The Wonder Boys' 1998 
    evergreen &quot;New Start&quot; in Studio Gr&ouml;t. Title (you guessed it): 
    &quot;New Start 2005&quot;. Since Gr&ouml;t does not play any instrument on 
    the track, he at least got to pose with this cool'n'cozy &quot;axe&quot; instead.

    used to rehearse), Karlstad, possibly 1985. Note: the song performed is definitely 
    not &quot;Sax Play&quot; - David was too shy to ever play his sax masterpiece 
    for his teacher. To hear the 2000 version of that number, check the mp3 section!

    Speaking of &quot;Sax Play&quot;, or &quot;El Disgusto&quot; as it was once 
    called in the early '90s (and before that just &quot;C#-D-H-G&quot;), here's 
    the earliest found attempt of writing down the basis of the melody. The use 
    of the in-joke word &quot;in&ouml;delt&quot;, would date it to ca 1987 (you 
    comics readers out there all know that David's first comics fanzine from back 
    then had the name &quot;D.I.T., De In&ouml;dlas Tidning&quot;). <br>
