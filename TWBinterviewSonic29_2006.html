<p><b>The Wonder Boys <br>
  news</b></p>
<p><img src="TWBinterviewSonic29_2006.jpg" width="894" height="647"></p>
<p><br>
  rough translation: </p>
<p><strong>All styles at once</strong> </p>
<p><strong>In front of you, two</strong> jack-in-the-box boxes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the handle of the first one, and for yes men with painted 
  smiles appear, proclaiming &#8220;we are a quartet, we play rock and we release 
  an album every two years&#8221;. Turn the handle of the other one, and everything 
  explodes; limiting genre definitions and band formats turns into a confetti 
  rain of nuances. Creative lows and restraints fly up in the sky, never to return. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wonder Boys live in that second box. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wonder Boys is a many-headed and extraordinarily fantastic 
  constellation, whose hub consists of the Stockholm-, Lund- and Skived-based 
  multi-instrumentalists David Liljemark (also known as comics artist), Christian 
  Kast&eacute;n (also known as Caroline Soul&#8217;s bass player) and Christian 
  &#8220;Gr&ouml;t&#8221; Gustavsson (also known as studio maestro). </p>
<p><strong>An abundance of releases, a myriad of songs in a lot of different styles. 
  David, how would you recommend a beginner to enter The Wonder Boys&#8217; world?</strong> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-If you prefer the early years&#8217; pig-distorted lo-fi-sound, 
  you can start with the collection cd &#8220;0,000 001 Million Wonder Boys Fans 
  Can&#8217;t Be Wrong&#8221; from 2001. Otherwise, our latest full length releases 
  &#8211; last year&#8217;s &#8220;Die grosse Schlagerparade&#8221; and recently 
  released &#8220;Passion &amp; Compassion&#8221; &#8211; are more varied hit 
  parades. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The gist of it is of course that you should have everything. 
</p>
<p><strong>And when should one listen to The Wonder Boys?</strong> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-There&#8217;s a song for every occasion. For potatoe eating, 
  shopping sprees, being frost-bitten, the tsunami, the day before Christmas, 
  self mutilation and letter writing, romance and being in love, breaking up and 
  being down in the dumps &#8211; maybe the latter in particular. But maybe not 
  so many songs for having sex though. It would feel like someone had fun at our 
  expence. </p>
