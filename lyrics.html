  <p>I&acute;m sad! I&acute;m unhappy!<br>
    So sad! I&acute;m not happy! <br>
    I feel mad! And unhappy!<br>
    Too bad! I won&acute;t let me <br>
    be glad! And be happy!<br>
    So I&acute;m sad and unhappy, but</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, better than yesterday&acute;s </p>
  <p>I drink! in the morning<br>
    I drink! at night<br>
    I think! every evening<br>
    about what&acute;s wrong and what&acute;s right<br>
    But I drink every evening<br>
    and always end up starting a fight, but</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, better than yesterday&acute;s</p>
  <p>I lose... control...<br>
    I refuse to play my role...<br>
    and I&acute;m too much into rock and roll! Yeah,</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, better than yesterday&acute;s</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, better than yesterday&acute;s</p>
  <p>I&acute;m &#150; sad <br>
    Never &#150; glad<br>
    So &#150; blue <br>
    and that&acute;s because of you</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, better than yesterday&acute;s</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, listen to what I say<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, but I said the same yesterday<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change my ways<br>
    I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, or maybe some other day</p>

    No less is what I&acute;m waiting for <br>
    I wait for the impossible to happen <br>
    I wait for the coming of the Lord </p>
  <p>A man sat down in the middle of the street <br>
    He had no clothes, not even shoes on his feet <br>
    an angry man opened his limo-door, screamed: <br>
    &#8211;What are you waiting for?! He said: </p>
  <p>I wait for the impossible to happen <br>
    No less is what I&acute;m waiting for <br>
    I wait for the impossible to happen <br>
    I wait for the coming of the Lord </p>
  <p>&#8211;Hey man, d&acute;ya think he&acute;ll come soon? <br>
    &#8211;Will he be here by breakfast or noon? <br>
    &#8211;Well, with the Lord, you can&acute;t be too sure <br>
    But if I have to, I&acute;ll wait some more, &acute;cause </p>
  <p>I wait for the impossible to happen <br>
    No less is what I&acute;m waiting for <br>

    He must be really dying to meet him <br>
    To give the Lord his best greetings <br>
    to date him, he&acute;s waiting <br>
    and waiting &#8211; and I&acute;m waiting </p>

  <p>May I have this dance? <br>
    The floor is empty of romance<br>

    Finish your glass of wine<br>
    &acute;cause we don&acute;t have much time</p>
  <p>Please, may I have this dance?<br>
    There won&acute;t be no second chance<br>
    Then we can both go home<br>
    as usual, all alone<br>
    or maybe, maybe not <br>
    (so come on)</p>
  <p>Can&acute;t you hear them play?<br>
    While the night is turning into day<br>
    and if you then would like me to stay, just say so<br>
    otherwise, I&acute;ll go my own way<br>
    (guitar:)</p>

  <p>GO DOWN BELOW [CK/DL] </p>
  <p>I want bad things to happen now <br>
    so I&acute;ve got deep things to talk about <br>
    &acute;cause now I feel just too alright <br>
    and I&acute;ve got nothing low to say today <br>
    I can&acute;t think of a word to say <br>
    to outrage this sunny day <br>
    I really feel awful nice </p>
  <p>So I need to go now, go down below <br>
    to reach myself and reload my soul <br>
    I need to go now, go down you know <br>
    I really need to go now, go on my own </p>
  <p>So break my heart, leave me to cry <br>
    right now I&acute;m in need of a heavy mind <br>
    and my guitar <br>
    I write lonely troubled songs <br>
    I write them just for you (about you) <br>
    and I guess I&acute;ll call you <br>
    Yeah, I guess I&acute;&acute;ll call you <br>
    the day when I&acute;ve broken all of my strings </p>
  <p>So I need to go now, go down below <br>
    to reach myself and reload my soul <br>
    I really need to go now, go down you know <br>
    I need to go now, go on my own </p>
  <p>1-2-3-4-5-666 </p>
  <p>So I need to go now, go down below <br>

    go down you know <br>
    go down <br>
    go go go, go <br>
    I need to go down below<br>
    I really need to go on my own </p>
  <p>But why did you smash my guitar <br>
    against the wall, against the wall <br>
    when you could have just as easily <br>
    shot me right through the heart, right through the heart <br>
    You pulled the plug on your telephone <br>
    and all I can do now is sit and moan </p>

    That&#146;s what he wrote trying to be hard<br>

    To waste on you</p>
  <p>That&#146;s what he said in his tiny voice<br>
    That&#146;s what he said when he&#146;d made his choice<br>
    But still the tone of love was in his voice</p>
  <p>So he gave it to her<br>
    He gave it to her<br>
    He gave it to her<br>
    (you give me sad days, you give me bad days<br>
    and saturdays full of grief)<br>
    He gave it to her<br>
    He gave it to her<br>

    that the universe really has no end <br>

    <br>
    It dragged my dignity through premature pain <br>
    Then stitched it back together again </p>
  <p>The day you get that the joke&acute;s on you <br>
    Your silent face will reach the ground nude <br>
    I lost myself and my shame weighs a stone <br>
    I&acute;m waiting for the Lord to come home <br>
    I&acute;m still waiting for the Lord to go home </p>
  <p>So come on <br>

  <p> THE DEFEAT SUITE [DL] </p>
  <p>Alone <br>
    Alone, at last <br>
    Alone <br>
    Alone, alas </p>
  <p>So this is where the road ends <br>
    On a one-way street <br>
    That&acute;s called defeat </p>
  <p>Feeling so insecure <br>
    shaking on the floor <br>
    but still begging for more </p>
  <p>Every memory of you is aching <br>
    I&acute;m still on the floor, sh-sh-sh-shaking <br>
    pounding on my head <br>
    don&acute;t know how to calm myself down <br>
    down </p>
  <p>Everybody said we&acute;d make a good couple, that is, everyone but you <br>
    Everybody said we made a good couple, that is, everyone but you <br>
    Everyone but you <br>
    Everyone but you <br>
    Everyone but you </p>
  <p>Every memory of you is aching <br>
    I&acute;m still on the floor, sh-sh-sh-shaking <br>
    pounding on my head <br>
    but still begging for more <br>
    gimme more <br>
    gimme more <br>
    more <br>
    some more </p>
  <p>So this is where the road ends <br>
    On a one-way street <br>
    That is called defeat-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t</p>
  <hr>
  <p> You&acute;d better lock up the cutlery, &acute;cause here I am again <br>
    That same old feeling, but now turned up to ten <br>
    Might slash my wrists <br>
    Might slash &acute;em twice <br>
    Anything to turn this hell to paradise </p>

    take a deep breath and <br>
    exhale all disbelief <br>
    now you should pay the bill, I think <br>
    for all the alcohol I drink <br>
    brewed from oatmeal, rye or wheat <br>
    to help me contemplate my defeat </p>
  <p>Sweet, sweet defeat <br>
    out on the street <br>
    Sweet, sweet defeat </p>
  <p>yeah I gave my OK:s <br>
    the wounds won&acute;t show on X-rays <br>

    &acute;bout electro shocks <br>
    but when we&acute;ve dried up our minds <br>
    let&acute;s see what unwinds<br>
    what if we empty our eyes <br>
    is there a blessing in disguise?</p>
  <p>Sweet, sweet defeat <br>
    out on the street <br>
    Sweet, sweet defeat </p>
  <p>but the stitches still itches (but the stitches itches)<br>

    &#8211; UH! </p>
  <p>well you could label me blue <br>
    and take all the credit too <br>
    all the love went corroding <br>
    &amp; made way for self-loathing <br>
    But when Christ made all our tears into wine <br>
    why the hell did he cry? <br>
    I had no party when I came here <br>
    I&acute;ll have no party when I go </p>

  <p> KINDA SAD STORIES [DL] </p>
  <p>There was a girl, she had a thing for long fringes <br>
    and one day she found a boy with quite a long fringe <br>
    She said &#8221;Please let it grow, you&acute;d look even more handsome&#8221; 
    <br>
    And he let it grow, and grow, and grow <br>
    Finally he couldn&acute;t see, but it didn&acute;t matter, &acute;cause he 
    was happy <br>
    But he couldn&acute;t see that she was cheating on him <br>
    She was making it with others, everyday, right in front of him </p>
  <p>Isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>
    That&acute;s kinda sad (sad, sad) <br>
    Isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>
    That&acute;s kinda sad (sad, sad) </p>
  <p>And this reminds me of the fisherman and his son <br>
    The father always complained and put him down <br>
    &#8221;You no-good shit, you can&acute;t tie a net to save your life! <br>
    With your sloppy knots, no wonder the fish get away!&#8221; <br>
    Until one day, the boy couldn&acute;t take it no more <br>
    So when the father opened the door to his little cabin <br>
    He found his boy, hanging from the roof <br>
    And whaddayaknow, he had hung himself with a perfectly tied knot <br>
    And for the very first time in his life, the fisherman cried </p>
  <p>Isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>
    That&acute;s kinda sad (sad, sad) <br>
    Isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>
    That&acute;s kinda sad (sad, sad) </p>
  <p>And all of this reminds me of a couple that I once knew <br>
    As a present on their wedding day I gave them a toaster <br>
    And they said: &#8221;Oh this will come to good use, you know, breakfasts 
    in bed!&#8221; <br>
    &#8221;Oh that&acute;s romantic, so sweet!&#8221; <br>
    But in their honeymoon suite they drank champagne in the bath tub <br>
    but they also, they also got a bit hungry <br>
    you know, they had been making love all night<br>
    so they had worked up quite an appetite <br>
    But that toaster fell into the bath tub <br>
    Yeah, that toaster fell into the bath tub <br>
    You know that part &acute;bout &#8221;&acute;til death do us part&#8221; <br>
    I think that&acute;s kinda sad </p>
  <p>Isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>
    That&acute;s kinda sad (sad, sad) <br>
    Isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>
    That&acute;s kinda sad (sad, sad) <br>
    Oh, isn&acute;t that kinda sad, isn&acute;t that kinda sad <br>

  <p> FROST-BITTEN [CK/DL] </p>
  <p>...and afterwards, it all seems like some kind of fever <br>
    in retrospect, some kinda weird fever </p>
  <p>like when people up in the mountains <br>
    up in the cold cold mountains <br>
    right before alpine climbers get frozen to death <br>
    frozen to death <br>
    they feel hot <br>
    they feel like it&acute;s hot <br>
    and they start taking off their clothes <br>
    they take off their clothes <br>
    and get frozen to death </p>

    I took off all of my clothes <br>

  <p> BLUES IN PARADISE [DL]</p>

  <p>No, it ain&acute;t all that nice <br>
    to live in God&acute;s paradise </p>
  <p>You said &#8211;My way, or the highway<br>
    We did it my way on the highway <br>
    In your late husbands truck<br>
    that&acute;s where we used to &#8211; hwahwahwa</p>
  <p>But Romeo could get off worse <br>

    Well, sometimes it&acute;s not <br>
    In moments like these <br>
    When your only comfort <br>
    is that she can&acute;t fuck around 24 hours a day <br>
    ...or at least not 25 <br>
    but who&acute;s counting, anyway <br>
    When in fact <br>
    she was sitting at home like Virgin Mary <br>
    watching tv, sitcoms <br>
    knitting, and sleeping not before to long </p>
  <p>(so go ahead and) <br>
    Burn the lyrics, cut the strings, if you really want to give in <br>

    <em>this,  too, shall pass</em></p>
  <p> Leave it Lennie<br>
    Cut the strings, throw your lyrics away<br>
  or just let it be</p>
  <p>When all doors are closed (Leave it Lennie)<br>
    why don&acute;t you try for the wall (cut the strings throw your lyrics away)<br>
    All doors were open (Leave it Lennie) <br>
    but I tried for the wall anyway (just let it be)<br>
    And as an eternal coda to that song <br>
    my tinnitus goes on and on and on </p>
  <p>Burn the lyrics, cut the strings, if you really want to give in <br>
    But leave it Lennie, just let it be, and I will be your next of kin <br>

    Does anyone really &#8221;live happily ever after&#8221;? <br>
    or is it something that just happens in books? <br>
    Prince meets princess, &amp; rides off into the sunset <br>
    &#8211; and then they rip each other into shreds </p>
  <p>Well this is my goodbye to you, my love <br>
    but first let me tell you a few things I&acute;ve been thinking of <br>
    You outta know what you&acute;ve done to me &#8211; again <br>
    Yeah I&acute;m gonna rub it in really good this time <br>
    So go ahead and hurt me back all you can <br>
    Yeah, you know this is a duel that&acute;s gonna be cruel, so </p>

  <p>Yeah this is my goodbye to you, my love <br>
    You outta know how you&acute;ve treated me bad all the time <br>
    No I don&acute;t remember love, but I remember pain <br>
    No I don&acute;t remember no joy, I just remember the strain <br>
    It&acute;s strange how all the butterflies just turned to bats <br>
    oh, how all lovebirds eventually will turn into rats, so </p>
  <p>Come on! Come on! <br>
    Give it your best shot!<br>
    Give it your best shot!<br>

  <p> I WONDER WHY [LP/DL] </p>
  <p>Why <br>
    do leaves <br>
    Why do leaves fall off a tree? <br>
    Just because the summer&acute;s over <br>
    it doesn&acute;t mean that life has died <br>
    and why, why is winter always so cold <br>
    for the alone at heart? </p>
  <p>I wonder <br>
    I wonder why <br>
    Why did you let me go? </p>
  <p>You left me all alone out in the cold and I&acute;m hungry and I&acute;m 
    crying and I&acute;m freezing <br>
    &#8211; bu-huhuu <br>
    But when spring comes <br>
    it brings life to all God&acute;s creatures <br>
    it melts my heart <br>
    But who, who sends a thought to the snowman when summer&acute;s hot <br>
    and days go by so quickly <br>
    Tell me <br>
    Tell me, darling<br>
    Do you? <br>
    Do you too? </p>
  <p>I wonder <br>
    I wonder why <br>
    Why did you leave me all alone? </p>
  <p>You know, life isn&acute;t always so easy <br>
    Why <br>
    Why do time <br>
    Why do our time eventually run out? <br>
    But just because my time is over <br>
    it doesn&acute;t mean that my love for you has died <br>
    But if my love hasn&acute;t died<br>
    tell me, really, does it mean anything to you? </p>
  <p>I wonder <br>
    I wonder why <br>
    Does it mean anything to you at all? <br>
    at all <br>
    at all </p>
  <p>I wonder &#8211; I wonder <br>
    I wonder why &#8211; I wonder why <br>
    Why did you let me go? &#8211; Why did you let me go? </p>

  <p>BAD LUCK CHARM [DL] </p>
  <p>I guess it&acute;s about time to confess<br>
    I never believed the story of Loch Ness<br>
    But here&acute;s to black truths and here&acute;s to white lies<br>
    And nobody knows why the baby cries<br>
    no baby, no one<br>
    (waa-ah)</p>
  <p>But I say Good luck, Jim!<br>
    When the medicine is kicking in<br>
    (aah...)</p>
  <p>We used to say &#147;better safe and sorry&#148;<br>
    But now we lost the energy to sit and worry<br>
    First time&acute;s first but second is the better<br>
    But it&acute;s not my fault for screwing up the weather<br>
    not my fault<br>
    no no no</p>
  <p>But I say Good luck, Jim!<br>
    The reaper isn&acute;t all that grim<br>
    (when he&acute;s in the mood)</p>
  <p>Look to the left &amp; look to the right<br>
    Everything&acute;s gone or just out of sight<br>
    Beautiful! Beautiful deterioration!<br>
    Beautiful! Magnificent desolation!<br>
    Beautiful!</p>

    I thought, well maybe I could do it too</p>
  <p>You used to make me smile<br>

    Even with red eyes<br>
    Yeah, even through the reddest of eyes<br>
    You used to make me laugh<br>
    (do-doo) <br>
    (do-do do dododo) <br>
    Oh, how I chased your tail<br>
    You snickered, and said I moved slower than a snail<br>
    But when you think about it,<br>
    What train could have followed your trail?</p>
  <p>You brought something out of me<br>
    Well ok, I guess it was me to a degree<br>

    Pinetrees are all around and the flowers are in bloom<br>
    I&acute;m walking down to Sugar Square<br>
    I hope that I&acute;ll finally meet someone there</p>
  <p>And I feel that life has only begun<br>
    In the Saturday evening sun<br>
    And I don&acute;t wanna waste it away<br>
    What if we all could save our special summerday</p>
  <p>Well it&acute;s a lovely afternoon<br>
    A child chuckles at his bunny balloon <br>
    I&acute;m shaking hands with a garden elf<br>
    Hoping this way I might catch up with myself</p>
  <p>And I feel that life has only begun<br>
    In the Saturday evening sun<br>
    And I don&acute;t wanna waste it all away<br>
    What if we all could save<br>
    a special holiday&#133;</p>
  <p>&#133;and walk on down the beach <br>
    in June <br>
    look to see the moving mountain<br>
    and look for cash by the fountain<br>
    God knows I&acute;ve gotten good at countin&acute;</p>
  <p>Well it&acute;s a sunny people&acute;s park<br>
    The sunshine keeps you warm even after dark<br>
    I&acute;m walking down to Sugar Square<br>
    I hope that I&acute;ll finally meet someone there<br>
    meet someone, love someone </p>
  <p>And I feel that life has just begun<br>
    In the Saturday evening sun<br>
    Oh how I&acute;d love to save this summer day</p>
  <p>Then go into hibernation<br>
    At some closed down subway station</p>

    And what about common decency?<br>
    Well that&#146;s the kind of stuff you only see on tv<br>
    - well, if you watch the re-runs</p>

    That if you only had one friend to say goodbye to,<br>
    you wouldn&acute;t be leaving in the first place<br>

  <p>THE ILANDA BARROWS FIVE [CK/DL] </p>
  <p>Hey, have you heard about <br>
    The Ilanda Barrows Five? <br>
    No one knows what happened <br>
    They left town in a stolen car <br>
    Late one evening<br>
    they went out to camp in the woods<br>
    popping pills in a tent<br>
    Or maybe I dreamt, &#146;bout<br>
    their experiment<br>
    Maybe I saw<br>
    really nothing at all<br>
    But did they come home?<br>
    And had their minds really grown?<br>
    Paralyzed in a tense<br>
    that doesn&#146;t make any sense </p>
  <p>One cut his heart out <br>
    The other lost his mind instead<br>
    The third got lost in the woods<br>
    The fourth took a dive and then<br>
    was drowned by the fifth of the bunch<br>
    who thought he was a giant rat<br>
    And that&#146;s what happened <br>
    To the Ilanda Barrows Five <br>
    Yeah that&#146;s what happened <br>
    To the Ilanda Barrows Five<br>
    Guess that&#146;s what happened <br>
    and I&#146;ll start carving a stone<br>
    for each mind that had flown<br>
    I&#146;ll pick ya a verse<br>
    &#146;n&#146;sing it in reverse<br>
    if nothing occurred<br>
    maybe my eyes were blurred<br>
    What if I overheard<br>
    gossip from another world?</p>
  <p>moments in time<br>
    and the scene of the crime<br>
    frozen like the tundra<br>
    where many a wanderer<br>
    stops</p>
  <p>Did they come home?<br>
    Did they come home?<br>
    Had their minds grown?<br>
    Did they come home?</p>
  <p>Paralyzed tense<br>
    Doesn&#146;t make sense<br>
    Paralyzed tense<br>
    Paralyzed tense</p>
  <p>One cut his heart out <br>
    The other lost his mind instead<br>
    The third got lost in the woods<br>
    The fourth took a dive and then<br>
    was drowned by the fifth of the bunch<br>
    who thought he was a giant rat<br>
    And that&#146;s how the story goes<br>
    about The Ilanda Barrows Five<br>
    Or are they alive? <br>
    Maybe I dreamt, about<br>
    their experiment<br>
    Maybe I saw<br>
    really nothing at all<br>
    Maybe I overheard<br>
    gossip from another world?</p>
  <p>Out for some fun <br>
    They were out for some fun<br>
    They were out for some fun<br>
    A good time was had by none (They were) <br>
    Out for some fun <br>
    They were out for some fun<br>
    They were out for some fun<br>
    Out for some fun</p>

  <p>LATER LATER MR. UNDERTAKER [DL] </p>
  <p>I heard a knocking on my front door<br>
    I thought, now who could this be at this hour<br>
    He looked pale, all dressed in black<br>
    Carrying a chessboard (uh-oh!)</p>
  <p>The reaper at my door<br>
    The grim reaper, oh what for</p>
  <p>I guess I&acute;d better ask him kindly to come back some<br>
    other time <br>
    &#146;cause now my schedule is full, so I say</p>
  <p>Later later, Mr. Undertaker<br>
    I ain&acute;t got no time for you<br>
    Later later, Mr. Undertaker<br>
    I don&acute;t think my time is due<br>

    Help grandma &#146;round the house<br>
    And lots of other things <br>
    I can tell you about</p>
  <p>He came back the next day<br>
    This time with a deck of cards<br>
    Well ok, I&#146;ve never been good at chess<br>
    But I ain&#146;t got no time to play with you<br>
    Not to be rude, but would you please leave<br>
    I&#146;m sure we&#146;ll meet again some day</p>
  <p>The reaper was at my door<br>
    The reaper, oh what for</p>
  <p>You know there&#146;s too many things that I want to do,<br>
    so I have to give you a rain check, <br>
    meanwhile - go play at patience!</p>
  <p>Later later, Mr. Undertaker<br>
    I still haven&#146;t got no time for you<br>
    Later later, Mr. Undertaker<br>
    There&#146;s always stuff I got to do<br>
    Say hello to the folks<br>
    Catch a movie with my bro&#146;<br>
    Play my guitar, play some pool<br>
    And hope to find the right girl</p>
  <p>Later later, undertaker<br>
    Later later, undertaker<br>

  <p>I wait for the impossible to happen<br>
    No less is what I&acute;m waiting for<br>
    I wait for the impossible to happen<br>
    I wait for the coming of the Lord</p>
  <p>A man sat down in the middle of the street<br>
    He had no clothes, not even shoes on his feet<br>
    An angry man opened his limo-door &amp; screamed:<br>
    -What are you waiting for?! He said:</p>
  <p>Sweet, sweet defeat<br>
    And whenever we meet<br>
    Oh, sweet defeat</p>
  <p>A long time ago (a long time ago)<br>
    She used to come and visit me (yeah)<br>

    But now all that is history (na na na!)</p>
  <p>I don&acute;t know why you&acute;re still waiting<br>
    Deep down you know that you hate him<br>
    What&acute;s the point in this delaying<br>
    It gets worse every day you&acute;re staying</p>
  <p>UH-UH<br>
    aaah <br>
    yeaurgh! <br>

    He&acute;s always drunk, if not, he&acute;s stoned on pot<br>
    Yesterday he O.D:d in the parking lot</p>

    Get a groove &#150; get a driver&acute;s licence<br>
    I&acute;m gonna move &#150; gotta gotta move<br>
    I want away from here<br>
    And away from you</p>
  <p>I&acute;m gonna start a new life tomorrow, I&acute;m gonna change<br>

  <p>IT TAKES GUTS TO BE HAPPY [DL] </p>
  <p>I'm not used to feeling like this<br>
    I'm not used to feeling like this</p>
  <p>It would be easy to freak out<br>
    Kill the lights and hide underneath the bed<br>
    But I'm fed up with the angst routine<br>
    I'm changing my habits, I'm changing my scene</p>
  <p>Don't wanna breathe in a bag no more<br>
    Don't wanna cut or bruise myself no more<br>
    I guess it's about time to give myself a break<br>
    I'm scared shitless, but I'm finally awake</p>
  <p>It takes guts to be happy<br>
    When you're used to things going to hell <br>
    It takes guts to be happy<br>
    It takes guts to wear a smile on your face these days</p>
  <p>And let the sunshine in <br>
    I mean out, 'cause, you know, it's hidden deep within<br>
    Every breath used to feel like drowning in tar <br>
    But now I can swim and that'll get me far (away)</p>
  <p>And I'm not talking 'bout Cranky Ol' Man Mr. God<br>
    that poor sod, he's not what I'm all about <br>
    But you do need some faith <br>
    A little faith in yourself<br>
    Just give yourself a break, and try it</p>
  <p>It takes guts to be happy<br>
    When you're so used to things going to hell <br>
    It takes guts to be happy<br>
    It takes guts to wear a smile on your face (these days)<br>
    It takes guts to be happy<br>
    When you're used to things always fucking up <br>
    It takes guts to be happy<br>
    When you're used to getting screwed over all the time (it takes guts)<br>
    It takes guts (it takes guts)<br>
    It takes guts (it takes guts)<br>
    It takes guts (it takes guts)<br>

    It takes guts to be happy (happy)<br>

  <p>A NAP [DL] </p>
  <p>Lay your head down soft<br>
    Turn off the problems of today, for a while<br>
    Set them free like dogs unleashed<br>
    Then they can't do us any harm<br>
    Let that white noise disappear<br>
    Sail away like little clouds up to the sky<br>
    Let's take a nap<br>
    We both could use some solitude<br>
    We all could use some solitude<br>
    la-di-too<br>
    la-di-too</p>
  <p>Lay down your head beside mine<br>
    When we're this close the aching stops, for a while<br>
    In this tense, there is no tention<br>
    No worries begging for attention<br>
    Let's roll up like black cats<br>
    We cross no streets, we do no harm<br>
    Let's take a nap<br>
    We all could use some solitude<br>
    We all could use some solitude<br>
    la-di-too<br>

    It never crossed my mind <br>

  <p>NEW TITS [DL] </p>
  <p>So you worked all through summer for a new pair of tits<br>
    You saved all your money for a new pair of tits<br>
    You thought if only, if only I had a new pair of tits<br>
    You baby-sat every weekend for a new pair of tits <br>
    You sold brownies for a new pair of tits<br>
    You mowed lawns for a new pair of tits<br>
    You collected bottles and cans for a new pair of tits<br>
    You wished for money on your birthday, meant for a new pair of tits<br>
    And when asleep, you&acute;d dream about a new pair of tits<br>
    You really broke your back for a new pair of tits<br>
    You sold your apartment for a new pair of tits<br>
    You&acute;d do just about anything for a new pair of tits<br>
    You thought you could relax once you got a new pair of tits<br>
    You spent your life savings on a new pair of tits<br>
    You blew all the money your late grandpa left you on that new pair of tits<br>
    You thought you&acute;d be happy with a new pair of tits.</p>
  <p>So now, at last, you got your new pair of tits<br>
    Yeah finally you got what you wanted, what you longed for so bad - a new pair 
    of tits<br>
    Now you&acute;re strutting around with your new pair of tits<br>
    How does it feel? Did you think it would be like this?<br>
    Now boys will approach you, attracted by your new tits<br>
    And they say that they love you, but they just love your tits<br>
    Yeah, still nobody loves you, they just love your tits.<br>
    There&acute;s still a void beneath the place, where your new tits now sit. 
    <br>
    Beneath the place that they sit, is a void, that can&acute;t be filled by 
    new tits.</p>
  <p>You worked all through summer for a new pair of tits<br>

  <p>IF YOU&acute;RE LOOKING FOR LOVE, LOOK ELSEWHERE [DL] </p>
  <p>I&acute;m sorry if I broke your heart, girl <br>
    Hope you won&acute;t feel too blue (hope you won&acute;t feel too blue) <br>
    But recently somebody broke mine <br>
    I hate to do it to you </p>
  <p>I know it&acute;s not satisfying <br>
    and I don&acute;t expect thanks <br>
    And though it hurts to see you crying <br>
    but I rather be frank </p>
  <p>If you&acute;re looking for love, look elsewhere <br>
    My heart is buried and I guess it stays there <br>
    If you&acute;re looking for love, look elsewhere <br>
    &acute;cause I won&acute;t be around <br>
    No, I won&acute;t be around </p>
  <p>So girl take care of your heart now <br>
    I know it&acute;s pure and true (know it&acute;s pure and true) <br>
    And we all get our slice of the love cake <br>
    Someday you&acute;ll get yours too </p>
  <p>And if I hurt your feelings<br>
    I apologize <br>
    although I find you appealing <br>
    I just won&acute;t tell any lies </p>
  <p>If you&acute;re looking for love, look elsewhere <br>
    My heart is buried and I guess it stays there <br>
    If you&acute;re looking for love, look elsewhere <br>

    -Dear diary, why is life so unfair? </p>
  <p>If you&acute;re looking for love, look elsewhere <br>
    My heart is buried and I guess it stays there <br>
    If you&acute;re looking for love, look elsewhere <br>

    But Jim, he never showed up<br>
    Eventually his time was up<br>
    The girl sat down next to me<br>
    And cried until she couldn't see<br>
    I said &quot;Read this book about Rimbaud<br>
    And soon you'll forget 'bout Jimbo&quot;<br>
    She said &quot;I've read it twice<br>
    But thank you for being so nice&quot;<br>
    Jimmy, you better beware<br>
    The next time I'll bring a book by Baudelaire</p>

  THE CAR RAN OUT OF GAS AND I GUESS WE RAN OUT OF MAGIC [CG/DL] <br>
  <br>
  Hey, Mr Mechanic<br>
  Can you fix this car? <br>
  It broke down for us in midway last night<br>
  The car ran out of gas<br>
  <br>
  We went out for a drive<br>
  Set out to be romantic<br>
  Then the weather changed, and so did the mood <br>
  The car ran out of gas<br>
  <br>
  A rainy storm came in<br>
  And we had a quarrel<br>
  With clothes soaking wet, cursing one another<br>
  The car ran out of gas<br>
  <br>
  Stuck in this town <br>
  Stuck with each other<br>
  The car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic (ooo, ooo, ooo)<br>
  <br>
  A sunday country drive <br>
  Picnic with a carwreck<br>
  Pushed it to the station, took us all night<br>
  The car ran out of gas<br>
  <br>
  We thought that we'd be lying<br>
  Kissing 'neath the stars<br>
  But we barely said one word to another <br>
  The car ran out of gas<br>
  <br>
  So, Mr Mechanic<br>
  Please fix this car<br>
  Fill up the tank and tell us it ain't all that tragic <br>
  The car ran out of gas<br>

  <p>Hey, did you know that in Sweden, for many many years, people didn&#8217;t 
    know about the potato, the glory of the potato, that is, until the 18th century, 
    when it was introduced by a guy named Jonas Alstr&ouml;m - <br>
    better known as Alstr&ouml;mer<br>

    sold clay pipes and tobacco<br>

    Linn&eacute; was so impressed!<br>
    He got angora goats from Turkey<br>
    A self-made man! <br>

    your boat until you&#8217;re not so low<br>
    Somewhere awaits a sold-out show<br>
    go Johnny go go go go<br>
    yeah, go John, into the glow</p>
  <p>The crow sighs Oh,<br>
    everything is so out of control<br>
    when the mood is like a jo-jo <br>
    &amp; what frog will kiss the princess&#8217; toe<br>
    I don&#8217;t wanna know</p>
  <p>Let the good times roll <br>
    I want a crash course in letting go-go <br>
    Cupid, draw your bow, or is it only for show?<br>
    A Wilhelm Tell duel, I know<br>
    But in time, you &amp; I will take a bow<br>
    &amp; kiss the front row<br>
    But time is moving so slow,<br>
    time is moving so slow...</p>
  <p>At last, here comes the love patrol<br>
    Go Johnny go.<br>
    A tree of cocoa will grow<br>
    so there you go. </p>

  THE CAR RAN OUT OF GAS (BLUES VERSION) [CG/DL; blues version: DL] 
  <p>Hey, Mr Mechanic<br>
    Can you fix this car? <br>
    It broke down for us in midway last night<br>
    The car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic </p>
  <p>We went out for a drive<br>
    Set out to be romantic<br>
    Then the weather changed, and so did the mood <br>
    The car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic</p>
  <p>(harmonica solo)</p>
  <p>A rainy storm came in<br>
    And we had a quarrel<br>
    With clothes soaking wet, cursing one another<br>
    The car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic</p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuck in this town <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuck with each other<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuck in this goddamn town <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with shit but only each other<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ooo, ooo, ooo)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic </p>
  <p>A sunday country drive <br>
    A picnic with a carwreck<br>
    We pushed it to the station, it took us all night<br>
    The car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic (sure as hell did...)</p>
  <p>We thought that we'd be lying<br>
    Kissing underneath the stars<br>
    But we barely said one word to another <br>
    Oh, the car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic (oh-oh....)</p>
  <p>(harmonica solo)</p>
  <p>So, Mr Mechanic<br>
    Please fix this car<br>
    Fill up the tank and tell us that it ain't all that tragic <br>
    See, the car ran out of gas and I guess we ran out of magic</p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Well, sorry lovers. I might be a wizard with cars.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this mechanic just can't fix your lost magic. <br>

    I won&#8217;t say why I ran out of town at the time</p>
  <p>We ran not one course, you know<br>

    two little bombs of desperation<br>
    on a highway fuse - a lighted path to lose <br>
    and here comes that lump in my throat again</p>
  <p>But in the heat of a cold cold winter <br>

  <p>Said hello to a deaf gay couple<br>
    talking current affairs<br>
    I won&#8217;t say who ran into town at the time</p>
  <p>Like that anorectic jogger <br>
    chasing her own shadow<br>
    a banana peel stopped her in her tracks <br>

    and here comes that lump in my throat again</p>

  <p>Look at us now <br>
    watch where we were bleeding<br>
    passion &amp; compassion<br>
    but the diamond still feels like a lump of coal</p>
  <p>Look at our arms<br>
    and read between the palms<br>
    a Rosetta stone of scars<br>
    you could say that there&#8217;s a million words for loss</p>
  <p>(too many words for loss! <br>
    that&#8217;s all there ever was! <br>
    out of words for loss!)</p>

  <p>THE GIRL FROM TORY STORY [CG/DL]</p>
  <p>Well oh yeah!<br>
    We&#8217;re gonna get it right </p>
  <p>Spent some time in the U.K.<br>
    it was just another holiday<br>
    Steve &amp; Mayumi were awfully nice <br>
    but Timothy really took the price<br>
    showed me every good pub in town <br>
    dressed me up in a nighting gown<br>
    King&#8217;s Cross to Islington<br>
    postcards to Gran&#8217; and Mom<br>
    one glove, dress code check<br>
    need another black turtleneck<br>
    class act, and loud as hell<br>
    Come on in, sang Mr Bonniwell <br>
    Meanwhile in St. John&#8217;s Wood<br>
    I got lost and I got lost for good <br>
    but then I found an afterparty</p>
  <p>I spent time with a girl from Tory <br>
    like a madman in a laboratory<br>
    was it love, it sure was inflammatory<br>
    we banged each other crazy in the lavatory<br>
    Spent time tidying up my story <br>
    like a dirty kid in reformatory<br>
    and the rest is self-explanatory <br>
    we had a little fling but she was a Tory, yeah</p>
  <p>Well oh yeah<br>
    You better get it right (&#8211; I mean Left, hahaha)</p>
  <p>Spent time in the U.K.<br>

    love or lust, it sure was purgatory<br>

  IF WE GET THROUGH THIS, WE&#8217;LL GET THROUGH ANYTHING [CG/DL] 
  <p>I drive the bus <br>
    like everyday<br>
    from the airport on a bumpy road into town<br>
    to the hotels</p>
  <p>and in this heat<br>
    an elder woman loses her lunch<br>
    a vegetarian souffl&eacute; <br>
    her husband wipes it up</p>
  <p>and the young couple in love on the back seat <br>
    smile to each other and say<br>
    if we get through this, we&#8217;ll get through anything</p>
  <p>and your dad <br>
    the sweetest man <br>
    the doctor plucked a giant tumour out of his head <br>
    the size of a golf ball </p>
  <p>when he woke up<br>
    he said to us <br>
    that &#8220;Golfers have the worst humour in the whole wide world, <br>
    so I guess it fits&#8221;</p>
  <p>I tried to laugh<br>
    I tried my best<br>
    but since he couldn&#8217;t move his legs, it was a lot to ask <br>
    but if we get through this, we&#8217;ll get through anything</p>
  <p>(clarinet solo) </p>
  <p>Then we heard the news<br>
    boy, was it a shock<br>
    every goddamn tourist in this town was swallowed by the sea<br>
    if we get through this, we&#8217;ll get through anything (anything)</p>
  <p>...And for a while, I couldn&#8217;t dwell on the thought of those other 
    men you&#8217;re meeting everyday <br>
    Don&#8217;t you think I can see what&#8217;s going on behind my back?</p>
  <p>&#8220;And now, <br>
    the end is near...&#8221;<br>
    the radio has a way with words, while I drive the bus<br>
    but this time it&#8217;s empty</p>
  <p>I can recall <br>
    couples in love<br>
    a lost souffl&eacute; on a bumpy road into town<br>
    but if we get through this, we&#8217;ll get through anything (we&#8217;ll 
    get through anything).</p>

  <p>A GIFT I NEVER HAD [CG/DL] </p>
  <p>Oh, the dandruff on your coat <br>
    so many years ago <br>
    It looked like stars to me <br>
    You were the universe to me <br>
    many years ago </p>
  <p>Youth kept us going <br>
    and youth tore us apart<br>
    Everybody knows it well <br>
    that&#8217;s the way things go <br>
    (uh-huh-huh) </p>
  <p>I&#8217;ve always thought small <br>
    my plans ended where you began <br>
    and vanished <br>
    like a frightened ghost </p>
  <p>I heard you got yourself a baby <br>
    a good man <br>
    and a decent job <br>
    to pay the rent </p>
  <p>I&#8217;m so glad <br>
    I didn&#8217;t ruin you <br>
    you were able to survive me <br>
    I didn&#8217;t destroy you</p>
  <p>All those Bergman scenes<br>
    and sandwiched inbetween <br>
    moments of pure bliss <br>
    deceitful like a Judas kiss <br>
    (Nah, don&#8217;t want no more of this) </p>
  <p>I&#8217;m so glad I didn&#8217;t ruin you for good <br>
    like I thought I would <br>
    All the scars I may have caused <br>
    I know they spell my name<br>
    But you were always better than me<br>
    at turning your back <br>
    to what&#8217;s bad <br>
    a gift I never had </p>
  <p>saying no to what&#8217;s bad<br>
    a gift I never had<br>
    Now, some of us can have a good night&#8217;s sleep, but not me, no no no 
    <br>
    Kiss your baby, but don&#8217;t kiss her from me<br>
    Let her sleep, let her sleep, let her sleep <br>
    I just poison everything <br>
    Brush the dandruff off of your coat <br>
    and all your memories of me <br>
    You&#8217;re still a star, you&#8217;re still a star to me<br>
    a gift I never had </p>

  GIRL, YOU NEED A DATE WITH COPERNICUS [CG/DL] 
  <p>I&#8217;ve got some artist friends<br>
    who&#8217;s pretty self-centered at times (aren&#8217;t we all?) <br>
    Still they&#8217;re kind and there&#8217;s a limit to everything <br>
    But you girl, you really take the cake (oh...) <br>
    I&#8217;ve had enough of your egotistical ways <br>
    &#8211; they&#8217;re just too much<br>
    There are different views than yours, you know (huh? huh?) <br>
    You&#8217;d be furious if I&#8217;d treat you the same way <br>
    Well I know it&#8217;s the age of me me me <br>
    Now, that&#8217;s no reason for treating me bad </p>
  <p>Girl, you need a date with Copernicus! <br>
    Everything doesn&#8217;t revolve around you <br>
    You&#8217;re not the centre of the universe <br>
    Galileo would have kicked you out! <br>
    (on the street... on your ass...)</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m pretty easy to please <br>
    so why do you just hurt me? <br>
    I guess you haven&#8217;t noticed <br>
    the fact that other people feel things too <br>
    you&#8217;re lost in ignorant ways, dear <br>
    You&#8217;re stuck inside of your head <br>
    now it&#8217;s time to get dragged out <br>
    Or I won&#8217;t be around anymore, see <br>
    You&#8217;d be furious if I&#8217;d treat you the same way <br>
    And I know it&#8217;s the age of me me me <br>
    But that&#8217;s no reason for treating me bad </p>
  <p>Girl, you need a date with Copernicus! <br>
    Everything doesn&#8217;t revolve around you <br>
    You&#8217;re not the centre of the universe <br>
    Galileo would have kicked you out! <br>
    (on the street... on your ass...)<br>
    Girl, you need a date with Copernicus! (You act like Ptolemy!) <br>
    Everything doesn&#8217;t revolve around you (Next stop: lobotomy!) <br>
    You&#8217;re not the centre of the universe (You act like Ptolemy!) <br>
    Galileo would have kicked you out! <br>

<p>BACK IN THERAPY [CG/DL]</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m jet-lagged <br>
    like a new-born baby <br>
    flew into town<br>
    on a J-32&nbsp; </p>
  <p>an airborne virus<br>
    I got my ways<br>
    to get what I want </p>
  <p>a free jazz cat<br>
    I just made my dysfunctions <br>
    into a career </p>
  <p>so take care <br>
    and beware <br>
    a snorkel might help <br>
    when you&rsquo;re under the ice </p>
  <p>way up north <br>
    can you find us a lodestar <br>
    among the polka dots </p>
  <p>well, I cannot <br>
    so is sexual intercourse <br>
    all that is left </p>
  <p>freckles <br>
    a pointillist dream face, oh it&rsquo;s spot  on <br>
    let&rsquo;s connect the dots </p>
  <p>it&rsquo;s a map <br>
    for your HMS Endurance<br>

    if Roger is jolly, we might meet again</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;s back in therapy again <br>
    Back in therapy again <br>
    I&rsquo;m sad to see her leave again <br>

    (I hope it does her good) <br>
    Back in therapy again <br>
    She&rsquo;s back in therapy again <br>
    So sad to see her leave again <br>
    Now she&rsquo;s back in therapy again <br>
    Good luck to you, and I guess it&rsquo;s well about time for me <br>
    to move on </p>
  <p>We made love <br>
    in the drunk tank, baby&nbsp; <br>
    yeah, I&rsquo;m still a romantic you know </p>
  <p>like Joshua <br>
    sounding the horns <br>
    now that&rsquo;s an original free jazz cat</p>
  <p>aw, let&rsquo;s face it<br>
    to-to-together <br>
    we got more issues than the Daily Mail </p>
  <p>so take care <br>
    and be well aware <br>
    that an ice pick might help <br>
    when you&rsquo;re under my sun </p>
  <p>She&rsquo;s back in therapy again <br>
    Back in therapy again <br>
    I&rsquo;m sad to see her leave again <br>

  <p>YOU GOT THE BULLET FOR ME [CG/&Aring;sa Lundgren/DL] </p>
  <p>what once was a bluegrass state<br>
    turned into a nightmare of real estate <br>
    that kind of graveyard is nothing new <br>
    just makes me think about me and you </p>
  <p>how we nailed each other to the floor<br>
    still always  leaving wanting more and more <br>
    but there always was a cloud <br>
    like an H-bomb trying to hide in the crowd </p>
  <p>I'll never be your secret saviour<br>
    I can't explain this strange behaviour<br>
    an extra lesson in misery<br>
    I also should be back in therapy </p>
  <p>But why, is it always so complicated? <br>
    exaggerated,  yeah </p>
  <p>I wish I was a happy-go-lucky<br>
    farmer in old-fashioned Kentucky <br>
    you don't need a walking love disaster<br>
    an emotional ghettoblaster<br>
    I&rsquo;ll milk cows and serve you for breakfast<br>
    then sell cattle to the state of Texas <br>
    the Wild West will feed  me forever after<br>
    I'll draw quick, but Cupid will be  faster<br>
    and you, you got the bullet for me</p>
  <p>go on, try for a state of grace <br>
    no point in eating when you&rsquo;ve lost the taste <br>
    they'll sort us out like a deck of cards <br>
    but still  marked, so we can't get too far </p>

    Put all the housewarming gifts <br>

  <p>REMARRIED DIVORCEES 
[CG/DL] </p>
  <p>So, what was the appeal? <br>
    I can&rsquo;t relate to anything I used to feel <br>
    What was the appeal? (for me) <br>
    If you were a clock<br>
    I&rsquo;d know what makes you tick (tick tick tick) <br>
    lying there nude under an estate sale sign <br>
    saying &ldquo;mix my ashes with printing ink&rdquo; <br>
    you were so drunk </p>
  <p>I was just a kid <br>
    I didn&rsquo;t know any better <br>
    I was just a kid so easy to impress </p>
  <p>played in my own division <br>
    sitting on the bench <br>
    caught up in trivia at Tommyrot Inc. <br>
    (&ndash; now wouldn&rsquo;t you watch me sink?)</p>
  <p>I wasn&rsquo;t up to much <br>
    You weren&rsquo;t up to snuff<br>
    But you can bet your ass that I wish you well </p>
  <p>You couldn&rsquo;t hold down a man <br>
    You couldn&rsquo;t hold down yourself <br>
    You always said &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave it to post-production&rdquo;<br>
    Oh, who could&rsquo;ve second-guessed <br>
    all of the dangers ahead <br>
    I was just a kid </p>
  <p>I guess there were some good times <br>
    But those times are gone (long gone) <br>
    Man, I was so miserable back then </p>
  <p>Now, all bets are off &nbsp;<br>
    But hey, where are my manners? <br>
    Mr Cushion, meet Mrs Whoppee (tee-hee) </p>
  <p>You got your social skills <br>
    I got a bottle of wine <br>
    In no-time, we will get along just fine </p>
  <p>You were worth the wait <br>
    Oh, you were worth the wait <br>
    You were so worth the wait <br>
    and you should know it (mm-hmm) </p>
  <p>Not alone anymore <br>
    I&rsquo;m not alone anymore <br>
    We&rsquo;re not alone anymore <br>

[...] falling in love at first sight, that is such a case. You see, you have a certain image in yourself, without knowing it, of the woman. Of <em>the </em>woman. Now you see that girl, or at least a good imitation of your type, and instantly you get a seizure. And you're, you're gone. And afterwards you may discover that it was a hell of a mistake.

DRUNK [DL]
<p>yesterday night was full of insight<br>
  yesterday night I had a full clear vision<br>
  last night was totally devoid of mercy <br>
  the night always tells me the truth </p>
<p>then in the morning I&#8217;ll start fooling myself again <br>
  that somebody might love me <br>
  that somebody might care <br>
  that someone actually might like to <br>
  be with me </p>

<p>THE DEAD PAY NO ENTRANCE [DL/LP] </p>
<p>Before a gig <br>
  in Nowhereville, U.S.A. <br>
  the bouncer asked &#8211; Who are your friends? <br>
  I jolted down a few names on a bar bill <br>
  but specifically I told him, listen up now </p>
<p>I said to the bouncer <br>
  the dead pay no entrance <br>
  told him specifically <br>
  If they&#8217;ve gone through so much trouble <br>
  to see me <br>
  just treat them nice </p>
<p>the dead pay no entrance <br>
  have a drink on me </p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve gone through that kind of trouble <br>
  to see me <br>
  don&#8217;t pay no entrance <br>
  you&#8217;ll see me for free <br>
  all R.I.P:s are V.I.P:s</p>
<p>you&#8217;re on the guest list <br>
  we&#8217;ll all be on the guest list <br>
  the dead pay no entrance, baby </p>

<p>A STORY (1978) [DL]</p>
<p>Once upon a time, long ago, there was a man who wanted to go on a picnic. 
  He nagged in every house he saw, but the people made a stumble-path and he 
  fell and was taken prisoner by the rat army. But the man escaped to his home 
  when noone saw him, because it feels sort of safer to be at home.<br>
