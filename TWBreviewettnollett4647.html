<p>rough translation: </p>
<p>A faithful and frequent band on these pages are the Stockholm based <strong>THE 
  WONDER BOYS</strong>. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;ve spoken well of them before and will continue my 
  superlatives here. A total of two demo records have found themselves to me this 
  time, through <strong>David Liljemark</strong> who constitutes the second half 
  of this duo. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, drums, 
  mandoline, balalaika, harmonica, piano + engineering, etc) <strong>Christian 
  Gustavsson</strong> and a number of friends (six, seven), they twist and turn 
  over 45 songs!!! It is two records that each contains a lot of music and lyrics. 
  I could write maaany lines about each piece of music, but will restrict myself 
  to concentrating on their latest demo that they call <em>Die Kleine Schlagerparade</em>. 
  Their last one, <em>Die Grobe</em> [sic!] <em>Schlagerparade</em>, was sort 
  of a collection demo, culling material from previously released cdr records 
  that they&#8217;ve released on their label I Wanna Die On Stage Records. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;ve never seen the like of a more prolific demo band. 
  I&#8217;m amazed. It seems like the duo have nothing else to do, but to make 
  music, at home or in a rehearsal room with their portable studios. A full-time 
  occupation, to say the least. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the recordings, they&#8217;re mobile between the three 
  cities Lund, Karlstad and Stockholm. It seems like they&#8217;re devoted to 
  an eternal dodgering and pottering. How does it sound then? It sounds really 
  competent. There&#8217;s no lack of variation and inventiveness. Sometimes I 
  gape with surprise. The material is so extensive that they could open their 
  own hit factory. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8216;Cause it&#8217;s swarming with little hits. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Die Kleine Schlagerparade</em> opens with a soft ballad 
  called <em>If We get Through This, We&#8217;ll get Through Anything</em>. Am 
  thinking about Paul Roland &#8211; anyone remember? And Robyn Hitchcock &#8211; 
  anyone remember? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joy of playing continues with a playful <em>Announcement 
  (Death Dredger) (Close-down announcement trombone only mix + original lyrics)</em>, 
  the bluesy <em>The Car Ran Out Of Gas (blues version)</em> with a beautiful, 
  simple backing vocals part by <strong>Eva Bj&ouml;rkstrand</strong>. <em>Synthing&#8217;s 
  Happening To You</em> &#8211; indeed synth:y and danceable &#8211; <em>Those 
  Were The Days</em> &#8211; with dist-rocky approach &#8211; <em>Something&#8217;s 
  Happening To You</em> and so on.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s not all pearls. There&#8217;s a couple of low water 
  marks for those who can only handle hit-oriented stuff. Residents-like things 
  as <em>Jesus Christ Super Sitar</em> and <em>Oh Lord</em> in the middle of the 
  demo are no <em>Schlagerparade</em>-contributions... <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#8217;s a crazy mix of all music styles. No quarter is 
  given. In conclusion, it&#8217;s a blessed mix of little masterpieces. Where 
  to start if you&#8217;d want to release a single? An impossible task! <br>
