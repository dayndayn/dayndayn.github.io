<p><b>The Wonder Boys <br>
  news</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nov 26, 2010:</b><br>
  We're terribly sorry for the lack of updates this recent year. It has to do 
  with extensive film work, a computer change, parental leave, and, well, more 
  film work, etc. The page has moved, and so did the mp3 server (hopefully those 
  links work again now). <br>
  Anyway, what's new since last time? <br>
  <br>
  Summer 2009 saw two special &quot;private&quot; live performances: <br>
  On Lars' and Nicole's wedding, Aug 1, 2009, the Honky Tonk Boys (Bj&ouml;rn 
  Radon on vocals, David on acoustic guitar and some backing vocals, and guest 
  start Tassilo Radon filling in for Lars, on a wonderful toy trumpet solo) performed 
  the DL-penned song &quot;Happy Blues&quot;. Please note Folklore Center legend 
  Izzy Young (Bob Dylan's old pal) in the left picture, sitting to the right!</p>
<p><img src="HTB_Izzy.jpg" width="677" height="283"></p>
<p>Two days later, David (sax) and his brother Dan (trumpet), played for their 
  dearly beloved Grandma, who turned 90 that day (her last birthday, as it sadly 
  turned out earlier this year). The set (once again) included &quot;Ja m&aring; 
  hon leva&quot; and &quot;V&auml;rmlandsvisan&quot;, and as an encore (which 
  may be of interest to the longtime TWB fan), a surprise impromptu performance 
  of... &quot;Sax Play&quot;! </p>
<p><img src="DoD_Mormor90.jpg" width="283" height="378"> 
</p>
<p>&quot;Den Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen&quot; 7'' was for sale at <a href="http://207.228.243.82/ss/cat.html">S.S. 
  Records</a> for a while, but when I checked back now, it seems to be sold out 
  (at their place, that is - it's still available through Lystring, though). <br>
  &quot; I Detta Satans Rum&quot; was apparently played Dec 15 2009 at <a href="http://artforspastics.blogspot.com/">Art 
  for Spastics</a>. <br>
  <br>
  David's 58 min documentary &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; (&quot;Traces 
  of Bernhard&quot;, Silverosa Film 2010, produced by Anna Byvald &amp; Lukas 
  Moodysson), was premiered at Gothenburg International Film Festival Jan 29, 
  2010. TWB fans should note that it also features Christian Kast&eacute;n behind 
  (and occasionally in front of) the camera; that the song &quot;Eva's Chair&quot; 
  (from &quot;The Grand Tradition Of Sitting Between Chairs&quot;) is included 
  in the soundtrack (mainly written and performed by David, with some excellent 
  help from old pal Mattias B&auml;rjed of Ants of the Underground, Nymphet Noodlers, 
  The Soundtrack Of Our Lives and Free Fall fame) and also &quot;Madrigal&quot; 
  (which is the mp3-only released &quot;A Story (1978)&quot;) without vocals); 
  that Bernhard is the man behind the lettering used for the TWB logo first used 
  inside the cd tray of the &quot;T.A.S.C.A.M. Manifesto&quot; album (later on 
  the front covers of &quot;The Grand Tradition...&quot; and &quot;Passion &amp; 
  Compassion&quot;). <br>
  &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; was later shown on &quot;Doc Lounge&quot; 
  events in Malm&ouml; (Feb 15, Inkonst), Lund (Feb 16, Mejeriet), Stockholm (Feb 
  23, Allm&auml;nna Galleriet) and Gothenburg (March 2, House of Win-Win). The 
  Stockholm screening also included - apart from the &quot;Efterlysning: Space&quot; 
  short movie from 2002 - a rare, improvised live performance of &quot;Ett stycke 
  f&ouml;r Bernhard&quot; (&quot;A piece for Bernhard&quot;), by David (sax), 
  Jonas Ellerstr&ouml;m (electric guitar), David Enemar (sax) and Nicole Vickers 
  (clarinet) - more members were supposed to attend, but couldn't do so, due to 
  the terrible weather situation. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="JPB_Doc_L_improv.jpg" width="378" height="274"><br>
  <br>
  Swedish Television (SVT) showed &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; on April 
  11, also had several re-runs the following week, and it was up for internet 
  viewing on SVT Play a whole month, until May 11. You can still catch a few minutes 
  <a href="http://svtplay.se/v/1948400/dokumentarfilm/klipp__jakten_pa_bernhard">here</a> 
  (until March 31, 2011), aswell as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rWN7x1cP3M">trailer</a> 
  on Youtube. It was also shown at V&auml;rmlands Filmfestival, Arvika (April 
  17) and on the &quot;Pandoras ask&quot; exhibition at Galleri Verkligheten, 
  Ume&aring; (April 23 - May 7). There's also a fan page on Facebook. <br>
  (By the way, &quot;Horst - munspelskungen&quot; was shown July 10-11 in a pig 
  sty (!) at the &quot;Party Paradise no. 2&quot; event in &Aring;bytorp.)<br>
  <br>
  <img src="JPB-dvd.jpg" width="283" height="425"><br>
  <br>
  In mid-January 2011 (Jan 12, preliminary), Folkets Bio will release the dvd 
  &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard och andra filmer av David Liljemark&quot;, which 
  includes the following material: <br>

<p><b> July 13, 2009:<br>
  </b>David has a new book out, the grand <a href="http://seriewikin.serieframjandet.se/index.php/Boltzius">Boltzius</a>, 
  which you can get from <a href="http://www.ordfront.se">Ordfront Galago</a>. 
  It begins with a 100 page &quot;drama documentary&quot; graphic novel about 
  David's father's mother's father's brother, the (in)famous and bizarre so-called 
  &quot;faith healer&quot; Fredrik August Boltzius (1836-1910). The reality which 
  the comic story is based on, is then explained in detail in 260 additional pages 
  of extensive documentary notes. Yes, this thesis-like book is one of a kind, 
  that's for damn sure! <br>
  <br>
  <img src="Boltziusbook.jpg" width="306" height="425"> <br>
  <br>
  Music bonus: One of F. A. Boltzius' (1836-1910) own songs was &quot;Wandringen&quot;, 
  which David set to (new) music a couple of years ago (a simple D-A-G-A chord 
  pattern), which you can listen to <a href="http://hem.sverker.se/%7Edayw/Wandringen.mp3">here</a>.

</b>Thanks to <a href="http://www.lystring.com">Lystring</a> boss and general 
inspirational good-guy mr Fredrik Jonsson's sweet distribution of <a href="twbDFV.html">Den 
Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen</a> (while selling off the new superb <a href="http://anka.dyndns.org/brainbombs">Brainbombs</a>

different tracks included on three different playlists; <a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/29381">Nov 
21</a> (Vill Du Dubba), <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/29411">Nov 
24</a> (Tom Top) and <a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/29423">Nov 25</a> 
(I Detta Satans Rum). The DFV single now also has <a href="http://www.soundonsoundrecords.com/newarrivals.htm">distribution 
in Austin, Texas</a> (billed as &quot;Slightly demented Swedish lo-fi pop whimsy&quot;).<br>

Oct 31, 2008:<br>
</b>Just thought we'd surprise everyone with some new mp3 tracks! <br>
&quot;<a href="http://hem.sverker.se/%7Edayw/NoWaveDisco-forErikAhlgren1727.mp3">No 
Wave Disco (for Erik Ahlgren 1727)</a>&quot; [DL/Erik Ahlgren] is about a man 
contemporary with Jonas Alstr&ouml;mer (!<a href="www.riksarkivet.se/default.aspx?id=12104">ereh</a>

Evaw On (7271 Nerglha Kire rof)</a>&quot;. The basic track was recorded at Studio 
Gr&ouml;t in Forshaga Oct 12 and completed the 25th at Studio Dayw, Bandhagen. 
<br>
At the same recent Studio Gr&ouml;t session, &quot;<a href="http://hem.sverker.se/%7Edayw/OneForDaddy.mp3">One 
For Daddy</a>&quot; was recorded, performed by David and a very special special 
guest star: Nora, Gr&ouml;t's daughter. A stripped &quot;<a href="http://hem.sverker.se/%7Edayw/OneForDaddy-bagsonlymix.mp3">bags

<br>
Another Studio Gr&ouml;t session from March 24 this year (with David playing guitar), 
coupled with a Studio Dayw session April 6 (with David and Anna playing clarinets), 
yielded two new tracks: &quot;<a href="http://hem.sverker.se/%7Edayw/ANewStatueForANewPark.mp3">A

<p><b> Oct 30, 2008:<br>
  </b>Now and then, The Wonder Boys (or should we say The Fan Boys?) have the 
  occasional brush with celebrity; David meeting <a href="http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/rose.html">Yoko 
  Ono</a> after attending a &quot;part concert, performance &amp; Q/A&quot; type 
  of event (&quot;<a href="http://www.st.nu/artiklar/utskrift.php?id=388574">An 
  evening with Yoko Ono</a>&quot;) at Kulturhuset, Stockholm May 29, 2004 and 
  getting his copy of the &quot;Some Time in New York&quot; 2-LP signed (see a 
  close-up in the Pictures section) + handing over the &quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/iwannadieonstage/twbalstroemer.html">Alstr&ouml;mer 
  Disco EP</a>&quot;, is of course a classic. <br>
  This time, on a piece of his own artwork (!), David got an autograph ...from 
  a BEATLE!!! <br>
  The thing is: <a href="http://www.petebest.com">Pete Best</a>, The Beatles' 
  original drummer (from Aug 12, 1960 to Aug 16, 1962) visited <a href="http://www.beatlessweden.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=939">Karlstad</a> 
  while on tour to promote his current band's new album, &quot;<a href="http://www.beatlebrunchclub.com/articles/peteBest/PeteBestTest_files/haymansgreen.gif">Haymans 
  Green</a>&quot;, and attend a Beatles convent. Because of the occasion (and 
  bear in mind that The Beatles - the post-Best lineup - once played in Karlstad, 
  at the <a href="http://home.swipnet.se/%7Ew-29168/Beattour1963.htm">Sundsta 
  aula Oct 25, 1963</a>), the very nice mr Carl Edlom (who has previously played 
  with Christian G in an unnamed post-&quot;Subtitles&quot; pre-&quot;Attic Drive&quot; 
  band constellation in the early/mid-1990s), assigned an illustration from David 
  to be used in <a href="http://www.nwt.se/noje/article69751.ece">NWT</a>, Oct 
  24. The result, made instantly upon request Oct 20, was this montage (yes, another 
  paraphrase!): <br>
  <br>
  <img src="NWT-illoPeteBest.jpg" width="567" height="567"><br>
  <br>
  The <em>utterly</em> good-hearted mr Carl Edlom (well, he's the hero of this 
  story!) then granted David's request for getting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Best">Pete 
  Best</a> to sign the printed page, bringing the paper to the convention Oct 
  25 - see Carl's photo below: <br>
  <br>
  <img src="Roag_and_Pete_Best.jpg" width="567" height="453"><br>
  <br>
  &quot;Pete liked it and checked closely&quot;, says Carl. On <a href="http://www.nwt.se/noje/konsert/article70094.ece">Pete 
  Best</a>'s right side is his younger brother (&amp; co-drummer bandmate) Vincent 
  &quot;Roag&quot; Best (the son <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Best">Mona 
  Best</a> had with the much-younger-than-her Beatles' personal assistant, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Aspinall">Neil

  (The doodle on the right - inspired by <a href="http://seriewikin.serieframjandet.se/index.php/Herg%C3%A9">Herg&eacute;</a> 
  perhaps? - is by Roag, who according to Carl, had some trouble standing in the 
  shadow of his big brother...) </p>
<p>And while speaking of early members of The Beatles - don't forget to check 
  out the truly, truly awesome paintings by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Sutcliffe">Stuart 
  Sutcliffe</a> at the <a href="http://www.stuartsutcliffeart.com">Stuart Sutcliffe 
  Estate</a> (see &quot;Important works&quot; links - all of them!). That none 
  of these paintings ever was used for a Beatles album cover, is in retrospect 
  nothing but a crying shame... </p>

<p><b>April 18, 2008:<br>
  </b>David guested ZTV on the first episode of &quot;<a href="http://www.playahead.se/ztv/ztv_program.aspx?programid=1d0c504d-3b32-462d-9a16-9959d9301b2d">ZTV 
  Presents: The Simon G&auml;rdenfors Trash-Culture Show</a>&quot; Monday 14:th, 
  22:00. Our dear friend, good-ol' <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gardenfors">Simon 
  G</a> (of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/klubblaspalmas">Las Palmas</a> fame, 
  <a href="http://simons120dagar.blogspot.com">etc</a>) brought David in to talk 
  about his obsession with (the &quot;Mission: impossible&quot; nature of) completing 
  his collection of the chewing gum card series &quot;SPACE&quot;, that was manufactured 
  in 1982 by Dandy Chewing Gum in Vejle, Danmark. Out of 100, #38 and #91 are 
  still as missing as they were in the mid-80s, and have never even been seen 
  IRL by David (but there's two different versions of #17, though!) -who has ca 
  670 extras (and even an extra &quot;SPACE&quot; box). If you have one or both 
  of these cards, #38 and/or #91, get in touch I-M-M-E-D-I-A-T-E-L-Y!!!!, and 
  you will be kindly rewarded... If you're familiar with David's comics, you might 
  already know about this obsession, but anyway, you can watch the &quot;candy-wrapper&quot; 
  episode of &quot;The Simon G&auml;rdenfors-Skr&auml;pkultur Show&quot; <a href="http://www.playahead.se/ztv/ztv_video.aspx?videoid=23938a6d-33e3-4f3f-9b82-3290fdc22df5">here</a>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyway, the &quot;SPACE&quot; quest hasn't got much to do with TWB's music - 
  at a surface glance, anyway! So, instead we'd now like to give away an old lyric 
  reference maybe few of you noticed back when. In &quot;(Stuck In A) Weird Conversation&quot;, 
  off of the &quot;<a href="twbtascam.html">T.A.S.C.A.M. Manifesto</a>&quot; album 
  from 2002, there's a line that goes: <br>
  &quot;-So I went to a SHoP on Hunt Lane - they always greet you with a SMiLE

  </b>...And thanks to our good friend mr Fredrik Jonsson and his <a href="http://www.lystring.com">Lystring</a> 
  label, The Wonder Boys have now made their comeback in the 7'' vinyl format! 
  250 copies of this beautiful EP - which comes in a fold-out sleeve - was delivered 
  the day before yesterday, but will get a proper release date in April/May: </p>
<p><a href="twbDFV.html"><img src="TWB-DFV.jpg" width="413" height="416" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Coincidentally, this also happens to be the by far strangest TWB release ever 
  (this far). &quot;<a href="twbDFV.html">Den Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen</a>&quot; 
  pays tribute to the swedish music elite with <em>very</em> rearranged covers 
  of tracks by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/klubblaspalmas">Las</a> <a href="http://www.laspalmas.se">Palmas</a>

  (&quot;I detta satans rum&quot;, the song that evolved into &quot;No Place&quot; 
  (lyrics) and &quot;Fuckmeat&quot; (riff)), and also features an interlude called 
  &quot;F&aring;glar (Intro)&quot;, related to <a href="http://www.purjo.com/david/skivomslag/flygande.jpg">Cornelis 
  Vreeswijk</a>. The sleeve is <a href="http://www.morganagren.com/discography/cd_detalj.asp?id=5&show=n">(re-)</a>designed 
  by graphics maestro Petter Sj&ouml;lund, and includes (to go with the liner 
  notes) a black &amp; white photo of David taken by his fianc&eacute; Anna Edin. 
  It's also the third installment of <em>Gylf</em>, a fanzine (8 A6 pages each) 
  by David &amp; Fredrik that came out in 1990 and 2001, respectively (2001 was 
  also the year when <a href="twbep.html">the first TWB vinyl EP</a> was released 
  - a few copies are still available, and everyone should have it!). </p>
<p><img src="Gylf1o2.jpg" width="413" height="269"></p>
<p>Gylf #1 (1990) and #2 (2001) - both extremely rare (33 numbered copies each).

  <a href="http://home.swipnet.se/sonoloco14/learning/learningframes.html">The

  GLO</a> at the time consisted of c:a 11-13 players, + some additional participants 
  from the audience. 13 different &quot;A4&quot; pieces were performed by the 
  group, some of them in two or more versions. David played saxophone (mainly), 
  and contributed one of the &quot;A4&quot; pieces performed: an untitled minimalistic 
  thing that started with a take on the &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; sax 
  solo (constantly riffing in E), which then gradually (d)evolved into free-form 
  noise. The closing piece of the day was Cornelius Cardew's &quot;Schooltime

  Although no correct answers were submitted (well, noone bothered to send in

  Ellison</a>, &#8216;cause he&#8217;s a nice guy who will probably appreciate 
  it. On this subject, we might also add that the new &#8220;dance track&#8221; 
  with the tentative title &#8220;050516-17&#8221; which is in the works, already 
  has two discarded working titles: &#8220;Venus from Willendorf&#8221; and &#8221;Concrete 
  Poetry Disco (dedicated to C.F. Reutersw&auml;rd)&#8221; &#8211; the song has 
  yet to find its proper lyrics. Then there&#8217;s &#8220;The Wonder Boys Might 
  Save You&#8221; which for a while was planned to become &#8220;Torture Reggae&#8221;, 
  but will most likely (on Gr&ouml;t&#8217;s insistent request) not be released 
  at all. We'll see! </p>
<p><strong>Important notice of possible FAQ nature: </strong><br>
  if you heard a track called &#8220;Stronger than you&#8221; by a group called 
  &#8220;<a href="http://www.thewonderboys.se">Wonderboys</a>&#8221;, or any other 
  track by them, be very well aware that <em>it has nothing whatsoever to do with 
  The Wonder Boys!</em> That group was formed in 2001 (according to their .se 
  website, which also has a &#8220;the&#8221; prefix in the url, to confuse things 
  even more. Thanks guys!). And all you good TWB fans out there, know for a fact 
  that by then, The <em>real</em> Wonder Boys (yours truly, who started in 1997/98) 
  had already released quite a lot of material &#8211; the first two cassette 
  albums (hailed as works of genius in the U.S.) and the vinyl EP. So, here at 
  The Wonder Boys&#8217; headquarters, we wouldn&#8217;t mind if &#8220;Wonderboys&#8221; 
  (*cough cough*) could have the decency of picking a new moniker that isn&#8217;t 
  already taken... (The DJ &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, who in latter years have played 
  at the Popaganda festival in Stockholm, is not of the &quot;proper&quot; TWB 
  crew either). Then there's a Norwegian cover band (&quot;<a href="http://www.wonderboys.net">Norges 
  r&aring;este partyband</a>&quot;) also... Are we going to have to do a &quot;the 
  London Suede&quot; (c'mon, you're Dog Man Star fans, right?) or change our name 
  to &quot;<em>The W&ouml;nder Beuys</em>&quot;?!??<br>

for the brand new ace track &#8220;If We Get Through This, We&#8217;ll Get Through 
Anything&#8221; (the best TWB song, this far?), with an unusually &#8211; not 
by TWB standards, though! &#8211; generous amount of &#8220;B-sides&#8221;. Some 
remixes are of songs from &#8220;The Grand Tradition Of Sitting Between Chairs&#8221;, 
like the new blues rendition of TGTOSBC's &#8220;The Car Ran Out Of Gas&#8221; 
&#8211; and to please our fans furthermore, we&#8217;ve also dug up another vintage

parents. The soundtrack is performed by Sl&ouml;phead (1984/85), Sl&ouml;phead 
II (1994-98) and the reunited Sl&ouml;phead (1998); there&#8217;s also David&#8217;s

Since this is the place to go for detailed info, we&#8217;ve traced the origin

old &#8220;idea books&#8221;, entry dated 26 dec 1998 (se excerpt below); it was 
finally filmed autumn 2001 (apart from the 1970s material, that is), edited together 
a year later, then slightly re-edited (corrected) in 2004. <br>

The Wonder Boys' new album is here!!! &quot;The Grand Tradition Of Sitting Between 
Chairs&quot; consists of 13 tracks, and just like an old LP, the cd fits on one 
side of a C90-tape. More info and track specifics in the &quot;discography&quot; 
section. To order it, send us an email and we'll quickly sort out the details. 
To quote our dear friend mr <a href="http://musicchamber.blogspot.com">Tim Ellison</a>: 
&quot;man, the album is something else!&quot;, &quot;Obviously, it's a big step 
forward for TWB.&quot;

  </b>Brand new &#148;Emma &amp; David&#148; cd-single out now! Features the tracks 
  &#147;Firefly&#148; (in two different versions) and <br>
  &#147;Might Aswell Be Dead&#148;, written &amp; performed by <a href="http://www.mine.to" target="_blank">Emma

  <br>
  <a href="emmadayw.html"><img src="EoDdockomslag1.jpg" width="125" height="125" border="0"></a><br>
  <br>
  Emma is the voice and sole songwriter of <a href="http://www.cabal.se/massproduktion/mine/index.html" target="_blank">Mine</a>, 
  who released two cd albums and a number of singles between 1997-2001. You can 
  (and should!) still get these through <a href="http://shop.textalk.se/se/artgrp.php?id=161&grp=591" target="_blank">Massproduktion</a> 
  and - at a real bargain price - through <a href="http://www.ginza.se" target="_blank">ginza.se</a> 
  <br>
  Emma has guested on a couple of The Wonder Boys tracks, providing vocals on 
  &#147;Granted&#148;, &#147;No Camera&#148; and &#147;The Car Ran Out Of Gas 
  And I Guess We Ran Out Of Magic&#148;.</p>
<p>(Bootleggers/collectors note: In the TWB vaults, there are cover versions of

<p><b>January 2004:<br>
  </b>Let's get retro! Sl&ouml;phead was a band in Karlstad, Sweden 1984/85, consisting 
  of Mattias Nilsson, David Liljemark and David's second cousin Martin S, who 
  played their own heavy metal-influenced free-form songs on tin cans, toy guitar 
  and a &quot;Venetian blind string bass&quot;. As a reminder, we would like to 
  point out that you can still download the complete recordings by Sl&ouml;phead 
  in mp3 format <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/%7Erichardc/slophead" target="_blank">here</a> 
  , thanks to digital mastering chief Richard Carlsson who cleaned-up the tapes 
  gloriously. For the cd cover, just send us an email and we'll email it right 
  to you. If you're an audiophile, or only have dial-up modem, or for whatever 
  reasons, you can of course also order a cd from us instead. 23 tracks (some 
  songs in up to five alternative versions), 45 minutes. <br>
  14 songs were written: Your Cruel Death, C.P. Child, Evil Eagle, Where Is The 
  Pen, Knock Him, Burning Electric, Ugly Witch, Woman Murder, Sl&ouml;phead, Winged 
  Assassin, Moonman, Ded Mans Head, Chopper Attack, Hippo In The Night. Not everyone 
  was recorded, though (neither the one-time planned cover of Metallica's &quot;Motorbreath&quot;). 
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="Slopheadcd.jpg" width="131" height="131"></p>
<p>There was also a &quot;<a href="http://www.valand.gu.se/newmedia/97-98/gunnar/pages/dayw.html" target="_blank">Sl&ouml;phead 
  II</a>&quot; in Lund/Malm&ouml; 1994-98, featuring <a href="SlopheadLiveSmalandsNation1.html" target="_parent">David</a>

  Sahlin on drums - listen to &quot;Burning Electric&quot; <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/%7Erichardc/sloptrack" target="_blank">here</a>). 
  Mattias and David had a brief <a href="http://www.geocities.com/iwannadieonstage/SlopheadReunion1998.html">Slphead
