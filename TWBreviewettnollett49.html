<p><b>The Wonder Boys <br>
  news</b></p>

  <br>
  rough translation:<br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Wonder Boys</strong> is comics artist David Liljemark&#8217;s own 
  play house which this time gives us a collected material called <em>Passion 
  And Compassion</em>. A whole bunch of songs. No ordinarty demo, it feels instead 
  like a full album in the &#8220;do it yourself&#8221; vein. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan Richman and Robyn Hitchcock might be guiding stars?. 
  Luckily it&#8217;s good song material available here &#8211; <em>There&#8217;s 
  A Bat In The House</em> is a suggestive story, followed by The Smiths-sounding 
  <em>The Night When The Losers Won</em>, and then the favourite <em>The Girl 
  From Tory Story</em> which is steady distortion-punk with grand choruses. David 
  is an un-shy songsmith, but I&#8217;m a bit afraid that he will drown his works 
  in gloomy productions (that is, no productions at all) and generally alternative 
  settings/attitudes. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it is recorded in Studio Gr&ouml;t <em>[=Porridge]</em> 
  in Karlstad, hmm... If so, it&#8217;s a shame, because the songs deserve to 
  get polished and the vocals need to have more consistency. Nothing wrong with 
  spoken vocals, but an artful producer might make it happen with some echoes 
  and stuff. Maybe Liljemark should take the opportunity to be a bit more theatrical 
  as a singer while he&#8217;s at it, it fits with the artwork as a whole, so 
  to say. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up: fun material, but not TOO goofy either. A very 
  interesting demo, which was this round&#8217;s ants-in-the-head for the demo 
  reviewer. <em>(RS)</em><br>
