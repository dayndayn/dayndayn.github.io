  news</b></p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  <b>June 25, 2015<br>
 </b> Finally, the 
   delayed 7'' vinyl single &quot;DFV2&quot; (Gylf #4) is here, released by <a href="http://www.lystring.com/">Lystring</a>! This follow-up to <a href="twbDFV.html">Den Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen</a> (Gylf #3, 2008) contains four cover tracks (and also includes an extra sheet, a flyer for &quot;Een Hommage&quot;), a limited edition of only 110 copies. Get it while you can! It's just as bizarre as the first one, or even more so. Good-ol' <a href="http://gardenfors.blogspot.se/">Simon G&auml;rdenfors</a> makes a guest appearance on the second track, a favour in return for the TWB/DFV sample on Far &amp; Son's track &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG3G-ge9SMQ">Precis som jag</a>&quot; (1:36, 3:09, 3:35; see also News entry July 1, 2013 below). <br>

<br>
The wait was just ridiculous. The wav files were sent to <a href="http://amei.se/">the pressing plant</a> June 10 2014, the artwork six days later. Then it took the pressing plant about half a year just to get back and say that they thought the running times were too long (it was no problem time-wise if you compare with the first TWB EP from 2001, but that wasn't made by them). Feel free to compare the times with the printed labels: 0:34, &gt;6:37, 5:20 &amp; 1:40. Some editing later, the song lengths were trimmed down to 0:30 <em>[the very first version was 2:45 actually, but that was never sent]</em>, &gt;6:28, 5:09 &amp; 1:40. Then later came instructions about the length of the run-out groove on side A and letting it run for a minute (the loop starts at 6:27:04). After even more wait, test pressings arrived (May 8) were they squeezed in it all (!), even <em>with</em> the added looped minute! For what reason, we don't know - stress, maybe? Second track got up to &gt;7:29 because of that, and they complained about too long running time?! Well, since we were glad to get a record from them <em>at all</em>, that stayed in and the records arrived May 19. But not the sleeves! They arrived early June instead; on the 11th the whole thing was finally made official and available to the public. So, we pretty much all in all waited A YEAR for this release. It was worth the wait, but I'm not very tempted to ever dealing with <a href="http://amei.se/">that pressing plant</a> again! <br>
Still, thanks to our pal Fredrik Jonsson for releasing the EP! Also, this marks the 25 year jubilee of our fanzine Gylf (check News entry Feb 8, 2008 below for pics of the rare 1990 &amp; 2001 releases). Now, dig a couple of classic vintage tracks from 1997 featuring David &amp; Fredrik: &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6-XztEiwoo">Copyright</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiPUIFf628">Do Not Talk About Elvis (Scotty Moore Is Still Alive)</a>&quot;! <br>
<br>
 And keep listening, lo-fi garage  alt. rock afficionados! <br>
Finally, long overdue in  digital form (instead of cdr remasters): <br>

<p>  On May 6, 2015, David's new book arrived: &quot;<a href="http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789170378577/bita-i-roret/">Bita i r&ouml;ret</a>&quot; (&quot;Biting the reed&quot;), published by <a href="http://www.galago.se/forfattare/david-liljemark/bita-i-roret">Galago</a>. It contains four 20-page comics written by David, drawn by Ruben Dahlstrand, Sling Lindh, Matthieu Cousin and Jimmy Wallin, respectively. This is, of course, an absolute must-have (well, you should have everything!). The first story, &quot;Pornographic Saxophones&quot;, was printed in english in <a href="http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789170375569/from-the-shadow-of-the-northern-lights-vol-2/">From The Shadow Of The Northern Lights vol. 2</a> (2010), and in french in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rayon-frais-Galago/dp/2849611182">Rayon Frais</a> (2012). In case you can't read swedish but want a taste of it ...<br>

<br>
The day after, May 7 2015, the dvd &quot;<a href="http://www.njutafilms.com/dj-rov-the-movie/">DJ:R&ouml;v - the Movie</a>&quot; arrived, published by Njutafilms. Basic facts about the now 18 year old comic character DJ:R&ouml;v (&quot;DJ:Arse&quot;) by David, Calle Th&ouml;rn &amp; Simon G&auml;rdenfors <a href="http://seriewikin.serieframjandet.se/index.php/DJ:R%C3%B6v">here</a>, and a trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzcu-iShSYI">here</a>. Old sins (&quot;rectal pills&quot;) from 1997-2003 collected in a 121 min movie with minimalistic animation, and some new ones too. The 9 min shortie &quot;DJ:R&ouml;vs begravning&quot; (&quot;The funeral of DJ:Arse&quot;) is included as an extra. (No english subtitles though.) Both movies were premiered at an <a href="http://www.seriestockholm.se/ai1ec_event/djrov-the-movie-premiar-och-slappfest/?instance_id=">event</a> May 7 at the lovely shop/subcultural mecca <a href="http://larryscorner.se/">Larry's Corner</a> in Stockholm. &quot;DJ:R&ouml;vs begravning&quot; was also shown at Klarabiografen in Kulturhuset on <a href="http://kulturhusetstadsteatern.se/Film/Evenemang/2015/Hypnagogia--send-me-the-pillow-that-you-dream-on--DJRovs-begravning/">May 9</a>, and on Kaf&eacute; Klaver on <a href="http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Galago-Releasefest-for-Bita-i-roret">June 11</a>, both also in Stockholm. <br>

  <br>
The 20 year jubilee of <a href="sugardaddyindex.html"><strong>Sugar Daddy</strong></a> (see previous News entry below) was celebrated with a new studio (!) recording, first one since 1994: the track &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIaItaNBpTw">6:66</a>&quot;, recorded in darkness at  Elektronmusikstudion EMS, Stockholm 21 Dec. 2014 by David and <a href="http://jayneinsane.se/">Jayne Insane</a>. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIaItaNBpTw&index=1&list=PLPROpcFFRDNPjZQ0IabzTYuxEDD7Nu1oW"><img src="SD666studiosession.jpg" width="882" height="267"></a><br>
  <br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FelchedByTheGoat/playlists"><strong>Felched By The Goat</strong></a> have been active with a number of new songs too: &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMVRC9lscTQ">John 6:66</a>&quot; (yes, indeed very similar to the track above!), &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM0M-q1l7cI">Cherubs</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPpVgtSLVkg">Goat Prophet</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWxYKJJdjIw">Rape The Carcass (again)</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy50yNOvZ9U">Blind Date</a>&quot;. FBTG also got a new amusing review in the &quot;Osignat&quot; column of Close-Up #170, Feb 2015 (&quot;Uppsala&quot;, WTF?! Among other errors...). </p>
<p>Well, then there was the release party <a href="http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Galago-Releasefest-for-Bita-i-roret">event</a> for the &quot;Bita i r&ouml;ret&quot; book (and &quot;DFV2&quot; 7''!) on May 11, 2015 at Kaf&eacute; Klaver, Stockholm. <br>
  You got a self-proclaimed &quot;sloppy&quot; Sugar Daddy exhibition of A4 xeroxes of old press cuttings and program sheets etc. First, David read one of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z6NkDPJrvk">&quot;wermlandian&quot; novels</a> about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E4g26er97c">a thigh-blowing saxophone player</a>. Then the &quot;DJ:R&ouml;vs begravning&quot; short movie was shown, before Simon G&auml;rdenfors delievered his swell and hilarious stand-up comedy goods. After that, <strong>Sugar Daddy</strong> played their first live gig since almost 7 years (!), thus celebrating 20 years also as a live act. The players this time were chief Sugar Daddy David Liljemark on clarinet, Fredrik Jonsson on clarinet (he also played on the first S.D. gig in 1995, and many more afterwards - check the <a href="sugardaddyindex.html">index</a>; Fredrik was  the one who introduced David to key inspiration <a href="http://www.borbetomagus.com/">Borbetomagus</a>' Snuff Jazz in 1994), longtime Wonder Boy Christian Kast&eacute;n on clarinet (this was not only the first time Christian played the clarinet, it was also the very first time the classic early TWB duo David and Christian played music live together!! Yes it's crazy), Tomas Antila on sax (also played the previous time in 2008), David Enemar on sax (previously played another - more tonal - freeform gig when the &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; documentary was shown at Doc Lounge in Stockholm, see News entry Nov 26, 2010 below), Ola Forssblad on sax (Ola helped out with designing the first Sugar Daddy demo cassette!), Erik Hansson on guitar (of <a href="http://a4-room.com/">The Great Learning Orchestra</a> fame, and his own group <a href="https://dylikt.bandcamp.com/">Dylikt</a>) and good-ol' Mats Jonsson as conductor (Galago editor, Fredrik's cousin and a <a href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/hey-princess/650">legend</a> <a href="https://seriewikin.serieframjandet.se/index.php/Mats_Jonsson">in his own right</a>). <br>
  The <strong>Sugar Daddy</strong> live performance of &quot;6:66&quot; can be heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abMwUwvt2-E">here</a> and seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g20LGyr7sH4">here</a> (with an extra noisy bonus recording snippet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHxJNROp7TU">here</a>!). <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abMwUwvt2-E"><img src="SD666live.jpg" width="425" height="239"></a><br>
  <br>
Finally, after Sugar Daddy, <strong>Felched By The Goat </strong> made their live debut (!) with a performance of &quot;Rape The Carcass&quot; in another new arrangement, which can be heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sePvQ3hqujM">here</a> and seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Lwoj-0yxA">here</a>. <br>
  <br>
  A Facebook photo album with pics from the entire evening can be seen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/david.liljemark/media_set?set=a.10153344791974976.1073741828.597154975&type=3">here</a>. <br>
  <br>
  The day after, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/118386695160849/">June 12 2015</a>, the &quot;<a href="https://vimeo.com/126748966">Jakten p&aring; Bernhard</a>&quot; documentary (2010; <a href="http://www.discshop.se/filmer/dvd/jakten_pa_bernhard_och_andra_filmer_av_david_liljemark/P88010">dvd</a> 2011) was shown at the occupied (by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/H%C3%B6gdalens-V%C3%A4nner/460041857492836">H&ouml;gdalens V&auml;nner</a>)  &quot;<a href="http://www.teaterkvarteren.se/">Folkets hus</a>&quot; in H&ouml;gdalen, Stockholm, with a Q&amp;A session with David afterwards (camera man Christian K also attended). <br>

<p><b>Dec 14, 2014<br>
</b>About time for an update, now what's been going on lately... <br>
<br>
Well, as everyone can see in the <a href="http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789198194401/let-there-be-feedback-when-i-die-the-wonder-boys-lyrics-1997-2012/">Let There Be Feedback When I Die</a> book (page 221), the 7'' vinyl single &quot;DFV2&quot; (Gylf #4) - the follow-up to <a href="twbDFV.html">Den Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen</a> (Gylf #3, 2008) - with four cover tracks, was supposed to be released in July, but even after half a year (!) of waiting, the <a href="http://amei.se/">  pressing plant</a> still hasn't delivered the goods, alas [labels are printed but there were difficulties with the pressing, they said]. &quot;Hold on&quot;, as Jamie Walters would've said!<br>
<br>
Cd remasters of the first two TWB cassettes are also still delayed...

The highly talented artist and black metal connoisseur <a href="http://denungeherrholm.smugmug.com/">Kim Holm</a> described it with these words:  &quot;It's  ear-splitting, ugly, and simplistic. It's foul, childish, and obscene. It's  silly, it's fucked in all the right ways, and it's very existence is a sneaky  finger up Gods ass. If you hate your life, your world, and your ears, check  them out. I fucking love it, heartily, fully, and erotically.&quot;

  </b>New book out now, published by <a href="daywbooks.html">Dayw books</a>! <br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789198194401/let-there-be-feedback-when-i-die-the-wonder-boys-lyrics-1997-2012/"><img src="LTBFWIDbook.jpg" width="383" height="580"></a><br>
  <br>
  Let There Be Feedback  When I Die collects David Liljemark's lyrics 1997-2012 for his band The Wonder  Boys. In 1999, The Wonder Boys released their first album and set off for a  ''wonderful, new start'' - although very much out of the limelight, despite  being hailed as a work of genius in the underground press. Named after The  Kinks' song Wonderboy, a favourite of John Lennon's, The Wonder Boys have since  amassed a large body of work in a variety of styles and subject matter. Songs  like New Start, But When I'm Drunk I Want You Back, Alstr&ouml;mer Disco, A Gift I  Never Had, The Night When The Losers Won, You Bring Out My Good Sides,  Remarried Divorcees, Ad Hoc Lovers, Satan's Death Waltz - you'll find the  lyrics to them all in this book.<br>
  <br>
  David Liljemark was born  1973 in Karlstad, Sweden. He is an acclaimed comics artist (Susanna &amp; Bo, Boltzius, Ritman  Katz &amp; Mannen med P&aring;sk&ouml;-ansiktet), author (Orkestern, D&auml; ha satt s&auml;j p&aring;  h&ocirc;vve) and filmmaker (Jakten p&aring; Bernhard/Traces of Bernhard, Horst - munspelskungen,  Tillbaka p&aring; Ilandaskolan), and also the main driving force and lyricist for the  underground rock band The Wonder Boys. He has also played with the bands  Sl&ouml;phead, Sugar Daddy and Endless Smile, and lives in Stockholm since 1999. </p>

  The entire sessions by David's childhood heavy metal band <strong>Sl&ouml;phead</strong> 1984-1985 are now <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MizajtnCcl0">up on Youtube</a>. <br>

The Manowaresque title of this flesh-poundin' contribution is &quot;Let each song title/band name we now write down be a black arrow of death sent straight to the hearts of all those who play false metal.&quot; All together now: AAAAAARRGHH!!!<br>
  <br>
<strong>Felched By The Goat </strong>have released <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQzBfOSdkgI">three</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN3cd7wQfpY">new</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN9nzvX96nM">songs</a>, apart from making the short but effective soundtrack to David's 28 min short film &quot;<a href="http://www.varmlandsfilmfestival.se/htm2014/ilanda.html">Tillbaka</a> <a href="http://sverigeskortfilmfestival.se/film/tillbaka-pa-ilandaskolan/">p&aring;</a> <a href="http://www.vf.se/kultur-noje/liljemark-tillbaka-i-skolan">Ilandaskolan</a>&quot; (&quot;Back at Ilanda school&quot;) from January this year. [Update: and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb0a0diXM1o">here's another</a> new FBTG song.]</p>
<p>  Earlier this year, David's new book &quot;<a href="http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789174412260/boltzius-vol-2-kompletteringar-till-boken/">Boltzius Vol. 2 - Kompletteringar till boken</a>&quot; (Galago) was published (actually, it was possible to order already in Dec 2013).

  You should also check out <a href="http://www.cloudberryrecords.com/blog/?p=1874">this old interview with Christian Gustafsson</a>, about one of his many early bands, Victorian Tin, which has a dedicated cult following that keeps on growing. You also get a nice run-down of other CG groups (including the infamous Baren...). The interview seems to have been made in 2006 or later, and it's curious that Christian viewed himself as not a &quot;real&quot; TWB member! Oh Gr&ouml;t, you're very real... <br>

As one of the many on/off members of <a href="http://www.thegreatlearningorchestra.se/">The Great Learning Orchestra</a>, David had the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkR87msW3XI&feature=kp">undescribable</a>  pleasure of attending two meetings/workshops TGLO had with the legendary, one-and-only J. G. Thirlwell (aka <a href="http://foetus.org/">Foetus </a>and a number of other monikers/projects) on May 17 &amp; 20, 2014. Check out some photos JGT posted on his Tumblr from <a href="http://tmblr.co/ZcI-_w1G7V7N2">Saturday</a> and <a href="http://tmblr.co/ZcI-_w1GVxCH5">Tuesday</a>. To say that JGT was a HUGE favorite of David's during the 1990s is an understatement; we're talking major hero worship at the altar of  Foetus! Very exciting plans are made, read all about it <a href="http://foetus.org/content/news/jgt-meets-the-great-learning-orchestra/">here</a>! <br>

<br>
In 1998/1999, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbe33jNTKz4">Sam Sohlberg</a> &amp; DL even discussed making a V/A tribute album to Foetus, to be called &quot;LOVE&quot; (this was before JGT used the title himself for his 2005 Foetus album), but nothing came out of it due to lack of money - except a 8:15 DL reworking of the Foetus classic &quot;Fin&quot; in the TWB vaults (&quot;David Liljemark feat. the Sugar Daddy orchestra (Fanboys over Frisco)&quot;, layered noise jazz that at the end faded into an old school sloppy acoustic blues with vocals), recorded Jan 10, 1999. <br>

<p><b>July 1, 2013<br>
  </b>It's time for a new cd: &quot;<a href="twbthebonusmanifesto.html">The B.O.N.U.S. Manifesto</a>&quot;, which is a &quot;<a href="twbdiekleineschlagerparade.html">Die Kleine Schlagerparade</a>&quot; type of release (if some of you thought &quot;<a href="twbbackinbusiness.html">Back In Business</a>&quot; was much too coherent and homogenous), with 28 tracks and a playing time total of 79:05 min! Track list and details in the Discography and Lyrics sections as usual. <br>
  <br>
  <a href="twbthebonusmanifesto.html"><img src="twbthebonusmanifestoFront.jpg" width="267" height="268"></a></p>
<p>The track selection was actually decided already in mid-March last year and the cd sleeve almost done by then too, but we thought &quot;Back In Business&quot; should go out first, the &quot;proper&quot; comeback album, after such a long hiatus. <br>

The soundtrack to &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; (&quot;Traces of Bernhard&quot;) and &quot;Post Scriptum till Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; plus plenty of assorted outtakes is finally collected on a 33-track, 79:07 min  cd, featuring David (guitar, sax, clarinet, scratching), Mattias B&auml;rjed (guitar, clarinet) and Jan Vogel (harmonica): <br>

<p>Since even more old <a href="http://blogg.sydsvenskan.se/skallarna/2010/04/15/bernhard-in-memoriam/">Bernhard Redenstedt</a> (1924-2008) notes from 1997 has been kindly sent to David, a new short video, &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rjcRFuvHh0">Jakten p&aring;  Bernhard (filmmusik II)</a>&quot; [MB/DL], has been put together with the ten notes (fronts &amp; backs) for all to see, set to the &quot;night&quot; theme from the movie (here shortened). <br>
<br>
After the 20-track &quot;C&ouml;mplete W&ouml;rks [2012]&quot; cd last year, <strong>Felched By The Goat </strong>made a come-back with the 2-track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSiUfzlM0fwwdwZHjrTukPnITKjZ2XO4o">&quot;Hircus/Futui&quot; cd single</a> and an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhWCJFrbhM">outtake</a>. <br>
<br>
More archive stuff on YouTube:<br>
Mattias Ullman's ambient noise band <strong>Endless Smile</strong>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7h_XoXXgrM">I Have Red Books</a> (ca late-90s studio recording),<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtGtV88VcVU"> Point Of No Shadow</a> (recorded live at Sm&aring;lands Nation, Lund, March 4, 1999), and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp8zNiS9FxM">track 1</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBwEVPyOXtM">track 2</a> from the most recent (hopefully not last ever??) concert by <strong>Endless Smile</strong> at Lilla Teatern in Lund, Dec 3, 2005. (David played sax/clarinet/bamboo flute on these four tracks.) <strong>Endless Smile</strong> was also discussed <a href="http://kssradio.libsyn.com/webpage/2013/02">in this podcast</a> from Feb 2013. </p>
<p>When was the start of The Wonder Boys? When David started making &quot;solo demos&quot; on his Tascam cassette porta studio in 1997? Or earlier (when, say, C#-D-H-G/El Disgusto/Sax Play was composed), or later? One possible contender is when Christian Kast&eacute;n came over to David's place (both were living in Lund at the time) and recorded the electric guitar track for &quot;Easter Chicken&quot;: March 30, 1998. <br>
  That marks a 15 year jubilee which we hope to celebrate in a delayed way later this year ... <br>

  <b>March 7, 2012:</b><br>
A new update sure is long overdue, we know. Well, please bear in mind that ever since 2006, The Wonder Boys have been busy with the next full-length cd, &quot;Back In Business&quot;, which hopefully shall be released later this year after an unusually long wait. After that, a bonus cd (similar to &quot;Die Kleine Schlagerparade&quot;) will be next in line: &quot;The B.O.N.U.S. Manifesto&quot;. Also, a cd with the soundtrack to DL:s &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; (&quot;Traces of Bernhard&quot;) documentary and related outtakes is planned aswell (....and some time, hopefully, cd remasters of the first two TWB cassette albums, which is VERY long overdue). <br>

<p><b>Nov 26, 2010:</b><br>
  We're terribly sorry for the lack of updates this recent year. It has to do 
  with extensive film work, a computer change, parental leave, and, well, more 
  film work, etc. The page has moved, and so did the mp3 server (those links should 
  work again now). <br>
  Anyway, what's new since last time? <br>
  <br>
  Summer 2009 saw two special &quot;private&quot; live performances: <br>
  On Lars' and Nicole's wedding, Aug 1, 2009, the Honky Tonk Boys (Bj&ouml;rn 
  Radon on vocals, David on acoustic guitar and some backing vocals, and guest 
  star Tassilo Radon filling in for Lars, on a wonderful toy trumpet solo) performed 
  the DL-penned song &quot;Happy Blues&quot;. Please note Folklore Center legend 
Izzy Young (Bob Dylan's old pal) in the left picture, sitting to the right!</p>
<p><img src="HTB_Izzy.jpg" width="677" height="283"></p>
<p>Two days later, David (sax) and his brother Dan (trumpet), played for their 
  dearly beloved Grandma, who turned 90 that day (her last birthday, as it sadly 
  turned out earlier this year). The set (once again) included &quot;Ja m&aring; 
  hon leva&quot; and &quot;V&auml;rmlandsvisan&quot;, and as a &quot;sax only&quot; 
  encore (which may be of interest to the longtime TWB fan), a surprise impromptu 
  performance of... &quot;Sax Play&quot;! </p>
<p><img src="DoD_Mormor90.jpg" width="283" height="378"> 
</p>
<p>&quot;Den Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen&quot; 7'' was for sale at <a href="http://207.228.243.82/ss/cat.html">S.S. 
  Records</a> for a while, but when we checked back now, it seems to be sold out 
  (at their place, that is - it's still available through Lystring, though). <br>
  &quot;I Detta Satans Rum&quot; was apparently played Dec 15 2009 at <a href="http://artforspastics.blogspot.com/">Art 
  for Spastics</a>. <br>
  <br>
  David's 58 min documentary &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; (&quot;Traces 
  of Bernhard&quot;, Silverosa Film 2010, produced by Anna Byvald &amp; Lukas 
  Moodysson), was premiered at Gothenburg International Film Festival Jan 29, 
  2010. TWB fans should note that it also features Christian Kast&eacute;n behind 
  (and occasionally in front of) the camera; that the song &quot;Eva's Chair&quot; 
  (from &quot;The Grand Tradition Of Sitting Between Chairs&quot;) is included 
  in the soundtrack (mainly written and performed by David, with some excellent 
  help from old pal Mattias B&auml;rjed of Ants of the Underground, Nymphet Noodlers, 
  The Soundtrack Of Our Lives and Free Fall fame) and also &quot;Madrigal&quot; 
  (which is the mp3-only released &quot;A Story (1978)&quot;) without vocals); 
  that Bernhard is the man behind the lettering used for the TWB logo first used 
  inside the cd tray of the &quot;T.A.S.C.A.M. Manifesto&quot; album (later on 
  the front covers of &quot;The Grand Tradition...&quot; and &quot;Passion &amp; 
  Compassion&quot;). <br>
  &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; was later shown on &quot;Doc Lounge&quot; 
  events in Malm&ouml; (Feb 15, Inkonst), Lund (Feb 16, Mejeriet), Stockholm (Feb 
  23, Allm&auml;nna Galleriet) and Gothenburg (March 2, House of Win-Win). The 
  Stockholm screening also included - apart from the &quot;Efterlysning: Space&quot; 
  short movie from 2002 - a rare, improvised live performance of &quot;Ett stycke 
  f&ouml;r Bernhard&quot; (&quot;A piece for Bernhard&quot;), by David (sax), 
  Jonas Ellerstr&ouml;m (electric guitar), David Enemar (sax) and Nicole Vickers 
  (clarinet) - more members were supposed to attend, but couldn't do so, due to 
  the terrible weather situation. <br>
  <br>
  <img src="JPB_Doc_L_improv.jpg" width="378" height="274"><br>
  <br>
  Swedish Television (SVT) showed &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard&quot; on April 
  11, also had several re-runs the following week, and it was up for internet 
  viewing on SVT Play a whole month, until May 11. You can still catch a few minutes 
  <a href="http://svtplay.se/v/1948400/dokumentarfilm/klipp__jakten_pa_bernhard">here</a> 
  (until March 31, 2011), aswell as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rWN7x1cP3M">trailer</a> 
  on Youtube. It was also shown at V&auml;rmlands Filmfestival, Arvika (April 
  17) and on the &quot;Pandoras ask&quot; exhibition at Galleri Verkligheten, 
  Ume&aring; (April 23 - May 7), then later (Sept 25) competed at Nordisk Panorama in Bergen, Norway. <br>
  There's also a fan page on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Jakten-p%C3%A5-Bernhard/233501539335">Facebook</a>. <br>
  (By the way, &quot;Horst - munspelskungen&quot; was shown July 10-11 in a pig 
  sty (!) at the &quot;Party Paradise no. 2&quot; event in &Aring;bytorp.)<br>
  <br>
  <img src="JPB-dvd.jpg" width="283" height="425"><br>
  <br>
  In mid-January 2011 (Jan 12), Folkets Bio will release the dvd 
  &quot;Jakten p&aring; Bernhard och andra filmer av David Liljemark&quot;, which 
  includes the following material: <br>

  </b>David has a new book out, the grand <a href="http://seriewikin.serieframjandet.se/index.php/Boltzius">Boltzius</a>, 
  which you can get from <a href="http://www.ordfront.se">Ordfront Galago</a>. 
  It begins with a 100 page &quot;drama documentary&quot; graphic novel about 
  David's father's mother's father's brother, the (in)famous and bizarre so-called 
  &quot;faith healer&quot; Fredrik August Boltzius (1836-1910). The reality which 
  the comic story is based on, is then explained in detail in 260 additional pages 
  of extensive documentary notes. Yes, this thesis-like book is one of a kind, 
  that's for damn sure! <br>
  <br>
  <img src="Boltziusbook.jpg" width="306" height="425"> <br>
  <br>
  Music bonus: One of F. A. Boltzius' (1836-1910) own songs was &quot;Wandringen&quot;, 
  which David set to (new) music a couple of years ago (a simple D-A-G-A chord

  </b>Now and then, The Wonder Boys (or should we say The Fan Boys?) have the 
  occasional brush with celebrity; David meeting <a href="http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/rose.html">Yoko 
  Ono</a> after attending a &quot;part concert, performance &amp; Q/A&quot; type 
  of event (&quot;<a href="http://www.st.nu/artiklar/utskrift.php?id=388574">An 
  evening with Yoko Ono</a>&quot;) at Kulturhuset, Stockholm May 29, 2004 and 
  getting his copy of the &quot;Some Time in New York&quot; 2-LP signed (see a 
  close-up in the Pictures section) + handing over the &quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/iwannadieonstage/twbalstroemer.html">Alstr&ouml;mer 
  Disco EP</a>&quot;, is of course a classic. <br>
  This time, on a piece of his own artwork (!), David got an autograph ...from 
  a BEATLE!!! <br>
  The thing is: <a href="http://www.petebest.com">Pete Best</a>, The Beatles' 
  original drummer (from Aug 12, 1960 to Aug 16, 1962) visited <a href="http://www.beatlessweden.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=939">Karlstad</a> 
  while on tour to promote his current band's new album, &quot;<a href="http://www.beatlebrunchclub.com/articles/peteBest/PeteBestTest_files/haymansgreen.gif">Haymans

  bear in mind that The Beatles - the post-Best lineup - once played in Karlstad, 
  at the <a href="http://home.swipnet.se/%7Ew-29168/Beattour1963.htm">Sundsta 
  aula Oct 25, 1963</a>), the very nice mr Carl Edlom (who has previously played 
  with Christian G in an unnamed post-&quot;Subtitles&quot; pre-&quot;Attic Drive&quot; 
  band constellation in the early/mid-1990s), assigned an illustration from David 
  to be used in <a href="http://www.nwt.se/noje/article69751.ece">NWT</a>, Oct 
  24. The result, made instantly upon request Oct 20, was this montage (yes, another 
  paraphrase!): <br>

  </b>David guested ZTV on the first episode of &quot;<a href="http://www.playahead.se/ztv/ztv_program.aspx?programid=1d0c504d-3b32-462d-9a16-9959d9301b2d">ZTV 
  Presents: The Simon G&auml;rdenfors Trash-Culture Show</a>&quot; Monday 14:th, 
  22:00. Our dear friend, good-ol' <a href="http://www.myspace.com/gardenfors">Simon 
  G</a> (of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/klubblaspalmas">Las Palmas</a> fame, 
  <a href="http://simons120dagar.blogspot.com">etc</a>) brought David in to talk 
  about his obsession with (the &quot;Mission: impossible&quot; nature of) completing 
  his collection of the chewing gum card series &quot;SPACE&quot;, that was manufactured 
  in 1982 by Dandy Chewing Gum in Vejle, Danmark. Out of 100, #38 and #91 are 
  still as missing as they were in the mid-80s, and have never even been seen 
  IRL by David (but there's two different versions of #17, though!) -who has ca 
  670 extras (and even an extra &quot;SPACE&quot; box). If you have one or both 
  of these cards, #38 and/or #91, get in touch I-M-M-E-D-I-A-T-E-L-Y!!!!, and 
  you will be kindly rewarded... If you're familiar with David's comics, you might 
  already know about this obsession, but anyway, you can watch the &quot;candy-wrapper&quot; 
  episode of &quot;The Simon G&auml;rdenfors-Skr&auml;pkultur Show&quot; <a href="http://www.playahead.se/ztv/ztv_video.aspx?videoid=23938a6d-33e3-4f3f-9b82-3290fdc22df5">here</a>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Anyway, the &quot;SPACE&quot; quest hasn't got much to do with TWB's music - 
  at a surface glance, anyway! So, instead we'd now like to give away an old lyric 
  reference maybe few of you noticed back when. In &quot;(Stuck In A) Weird Conversation&quot;, 
  off of the &quot;<a href="twbtascam.html">T.A.S.C.A.M. Manifesto</a>&quot; album 
  from 2002, there's a line that goes: <br>
  &quot;-So I went to a SHoP on Hunt Lane - they always greet you with a SMiLE 
  :-)&quot; <br>
  This, of course, was (and still is) a tribute to Jon Hunt's &amp; John Lane's 
  great (and now pretty much lost) &quot;<a href="http://www.thesmileshop.net/index.php/Main_Page">SMiLE 
  Shop</a>&quot; web site, about Brian Wilson's &amp; the Beach Boys' at the time

  (this far). &quot;<a href="twbDFV.html">Den Flygande V&auml;rml&auml;nningen</a>&quot; 
  pays tribute to the swedish music elite with <em>very</em> rearranged covers

  by graphics maestro Petter Sj&ouml;lund, and includes (to go with the liner 
  notes) a black &amp; white photo of David taken by his fianc&eacute; Anna Edin. 
  It's also the third installment of <em>Gylf</em>, a fanzine (8 A6 pages each) 
  by David &amp; Fredrik that came out in 1990 and 2001, respectively (2001 was 
  also the year when <a href="twbep.html">the first TWB vinyl EP</a> was released

  GLO</a> at the time consisted of c:a 11-13 players, + some additional participants 
  from the audience. 13 different &quot;A4&quot; pieces were performed by the 
  group, some of them in two or more versions. David played saxophone (mainly), 
  and contributed one of the &quot;A4&quot; pieces performed: an untitled minimalistic 
  thing that started with a take on the &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot; sax 
  solo (constantly riffing in E), which then gradually (d)evolved into free-form 
  noise. The closing piece of the day was Cornelius Cardew's &quot;Schooltime

  with the tentative title &#8220;050516-17&#8221; which is in the works, already 
  has two discarded working titles: &#8220;Venus from Willendorf&#8221; and &#8221;Concrete 
  Poetry Disco (dedicated to C.F. Reutersw&auml;rd)&#8221; &#8211; the song has 
  yet to find its proper lyrics. Then there&#8217;s &#8220;The Wonder Boys Might 
  Save You&#8221; which for a while was planned to become &#8220;Torture Reggae&#8221;, 
  but will most likely (on Gr&ouml;t&#8217;s insistent request) not be released 
  at all. We'll see! </p>
<p><strong>Important notice of possible FAQ nature: </strong><br>
  if you heard a track called &#8220;Stronger than you&#8221; by a group called 
  &#8220;<a href="http://www.thewonderboys.se">Wonderboys</a>&#8221;, or any other 
  track by them, be very well aware that <em>it has nothing whatsoever to do with 
  The Wonder Boys!</em> That group was formed in 2001 (according to their .se 
  website, which also has a &#8220;the&#8221; prefix in the url, to confuse things 
  even more. Thanks guys!). And all you good TWB fans out there, know for a fact 
  that by then, The <em>real</em> Wonder Boys (yours truly, who started in 1997/98) 
  had already released quite a lot of material &#8211; the first two cassette 
  albums (hailed as works of genius in the U.S.) and the vinyl EP. So, here at 
  The Wonder Boys&#8217; headquarters, we wouldn&#8217;t mind if &#8220;Wonderboys&#8221; 
  (*cough cough*) could have the decency of picking a new moniker that isn&#8217;t 
  already taken... (The DJ &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, who in latter years have played 
  at the Popaganda festival in Stockholm, is not of the &quot;proper&quot; TWB 
  crew either). Then there's a Norwegian cover band (&quot;<a href="http://www.wonderboys.net">Norges 
  r&aring;este partyband</a>&quot;) also... Are we going to have to do a &quot;the 
  London Suede&quot; (c'mon, you're Dog Man Star fans, right?) or change our name 
  to &quot;<em>The W&ouml;nder Beuys</em>&quot;?!??<br>

II (1994-98) and the reunited Sl&ouml;phead (1998); there&#8217;s also David&#8217;s

finally filmed autumn 2001 (apart from the 1970s material, that is), edited together

  </b>Let's get retro! Sl&ouml;phead was a band in Karlstad, Sweden 1984/85, consisting 
  of Mattias Nilsson, David Liljemark and David's second cousin Martin S, who 
  played their own heavy metal-influenced free-form songs on tin cans, toy guitar 
  and a &quot;Venetian blind string bass&quot;. As a reminder, we would like to 
  point out that you can still download the complete recordings by Sl&ouml;phead 
  in mp3 format <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/%7Erichardc/slophead" target="_blank">here</a> 
  , thanks to digital mastering chief Richard Carlsson who cleaned-up the tapes 
  gloriously. For the cd cover, just send us an email and we'll email it right 
  to you. If you're an audiophile, or only have dial-up modem, or for whatever 
  reasons, you can of course also order a cd from us instead. 23 tracks (some 
  songs in up to five alternative versions), 45 minutes. <br>
  14 songs were written: Your Cruel Death, C.P. Child, Evil Eagle, Where Is The 
  Pen, Knock Him, Burning Electric, Ugly Witch, Woman Murder, Sl&ouml;phead, Winged 
  Assassin, Moonman, Ded Mans Head, Chopper Attack, Hippo In The Night. Not everyone 
  was recorded, though (neither the one-time planned cover of Metallica's &quot;Motorbreath&quot;).
