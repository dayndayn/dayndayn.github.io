  Notes: <br>
  A few people have mistaken the fake &#8220;cut up&#8221; alternative song titles 
  on the back cover, for the real ones. Maybe we just have to do a song called 
  &#8220;Say Why You Ran Out Of Time At The Time&#8221; after all?<br>
  Also, we all know that we&#8217;re approaching the 5 year anniversary of the 
  &#8220;...And It&#8217;s A Wonderful, New Start&#8221; cassette album release, 
  but the strange &#8220;10 year long existence&#8221; line in this review raises 
  the question of - when did The Wonder Boys start? March 30, 1998 maybe, when, 
  after some talk about playing together, Christian K played guitar on David&#8217;s 
  &#8220;Tell Me What To Do&#8221; and laid down the guitar track to what became 
  the very first CK/DL-song, &#8220;Easter Chicken&#8221;? But songs by David 
  recorded before that have been used, from 1997 and earlier - not to mention 
  &#8220;Sax Play&#8221;, which was written - and demo'ed - in the latter half 
  of the 80&#8217;s (!). <br>
